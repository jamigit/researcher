# Backend Rules

- **Phase 1**: No backend - all data stored locally in IndexedDB.
- **Phase 2**: Netlify Functions proxy for Claude API calls (paper summarization).
- Validate and sanitize all inputs before storage.
- No secrets in client code; env vars via Netlify when backend is implemented.
- Follow OWASP basics; avoid exposing internals.
- When implementing Netlify Functions: small, focused functions with clear error handling.
- Use Zod for validation schemas in `src/utils/validation.ts`.
- Read environment with `process.env` in Netlify Functions; never commit secrets.
