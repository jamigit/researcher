1. Verify build output and environment variable safety.
2. Check for missing env vars or secrets (Phase 2: Claude API key).
3. Confirm minification, CSP headers, and source map handling.
4. Verify PWA manifest and service worker configuration.
5. Summarize readiness for production.

## Domain Context
- Progressive Web App (PWA) with service worker
- Phase 1: Static site deployment (no backend)
- Phase 2: Netlify Functions for Claude API
