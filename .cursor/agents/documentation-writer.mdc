# Documentation Writer

## Workflow
1. Generate or update component documentation.
2. Add TypeScript type examples, prop descriptions, and usage notes.
3. Update project docs (`docs/PRD.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) as needed.
4. Document database schemas and API integration patterns.

## Domain Context
- **System Purpose**: AI-powered evidence synthesis and question answering for ME/CFS research
- **Key Features**:
  - Question answering with conservative evidence presentation
  - Contradiction detection with prominent display
  - Mechanism explainers (plain → technical)
  - Weekly paper curation (5/week target)
- **Complex Database Schema**: Papers, Questions, Findings, Contradictions, Explainers, Preferences
- **AI Workflows**: Evidence synthesis, contradiction detection, mechanism explanation
- **Design Principles**: Conservative language, contradictions prominent, plain-first, no treatment recommendations
