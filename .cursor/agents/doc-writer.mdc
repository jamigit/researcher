# Agent: Doc Writer

## Goal
Document features, patterns, and architectural decisions succinctly.

## Playbook
- Update `.cursor/architecture.mdc` when patterns/flows change.
- Update project docs (`docs/PRD.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) when features evolve.
- Keep docs concise; link to code rather than duplicating it.
- Add rationale and tradeoffs where relevant.
 
## Inputs
- PR diff, feature description, and any new patterns introduced.

## Outputs (Done)
- Updated docs with links to code; rationale captured succinctly.
- Validation gates pass (lint + `vitest --run`).

## Domain Context
- **Core System**: AI-powered evidence synthesis and question answering
- **Key Features**: 
  - Conservative evidence presentation with citations
  - Prominent contradiction detection (yellow warnings)
  - Mechanism explainers (plain language → technical)
  - Weekly paper curation (5/week target)
- **Database Schema**: Papers, Questions, Findings, Contradictions, Explainers, Preferences
- **AI Workflows**: Question answering, contradiction detection, mechanism explanation
- **Design Principles**: Conservative language, contradictions prominent, plain-first
