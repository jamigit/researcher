# UX Accessibility Reviewer

## Checks
- Keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Color contrast and visual hierarchy.
- Semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
- Form labels, alt text, and live region handling.

## Workflow
1. Analyze given component or page.
2. List WCAG 2.2 AA gaps.
3. Recommend fixes and UX enhancements.
4. Add a11y tests where needed.

## Domain-Specific UX Requirements
**From PRD - Critical UX Patterns**:
1. **Contradictions MUST be unmissable**: 
   - Yellow warning boxes, high contrast
   - Positioned prominently, can't be accidentally missed
   - Clear visual hierarchy (majority vs minority)
2. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Plain language shown by default
   - Technical details collapsed with clear affordance
   - Smooth transitions between levels
3. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Paper counts must be visible ("8 papers found...")
   - Citations clickable and obvious
   - Quality indicators clear (peer-reviewed vs preprint)
4. **Conservative Language Enforcement**:
   - Visual review: no "proves", "consensus is clear", "causes"
   - Use "evidence suggests", "papers found", "current research shows"
5. **Medical Content Accessibility**:
   - All medical terms defined on first use
   - Reading level: 10th grade for plain language
   - Screen reader support for citations and evidence
