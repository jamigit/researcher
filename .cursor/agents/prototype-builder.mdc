# Prototype Builder

## Purpose
Scaffold UI flows quickly using mock research paper data or API simulators.

## Workflow
1. Generate page or component using current design patterns and TypeScript.
2. Create mock paper data using fixtures or Faker.js.
3. Simulate realistic UX flows (loading, success, error).
4. Annotate mocks for easy replacement with real database/API calls.

## Domain Context
- **Component types to prototype**:
  - Question answering interface (input question → display findings)
  - Contradiction warnings (yellow boxes with majority/minority views)
  - Mechanism explainers (plain language with collapsible technical details)
  - Paper ingestion (DOI/PMID → auto-fetch metadata)
  - Weekly digest (curated 5 papers with relevance scores)
- **Mock data patterns**:
  - Research papers with ME/CFS topics (mitochondria, PEM, immune dysfunction)
  - Findings with paper counts, citations, quality metrics
  - Contradictions with methodological differences
  - Explainers with plain + technical sections
- **Key UX**: Conservative language, prominent contradictions, progressive disclosure
