Ponzio 3  Departments of Neurosciences 1   and Pathology, 3   University of Medicine and Dentistry—New Jersey Medical School, and Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, 2   Newark, New Jersey  Chronic fatigue syndrome is a medically unexplained ail- ment characterized by new onset of fatigue accompanied by rheumatological, infectious, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Because the ailment often begins suddenly with a flu-like pre- sentation, early pathophysiological ideas as to cause included viral infection and immune activation. When early reports identified putative immunological abnormalities in this illness, it was given the name of chronic fatigue and immune dysfunc- tion syndrome, or CFIDS. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the immunological literature to determine if strong evidence to support this no- tion exists. We collected and reviewed 239 published papers, of which only 72 fulfilled a set of criteria for use in this review. For this review, we developed the following criteria: papers had to be published in the peer review literature; patients had to be from a group with substantial fatigue lasting at least 6 months (the vast majority fulfilled either the 1988 [21] or the 1994 [13] case definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [CFS]); papers had to compare CFS patients to healthy controls; and actual data had to be shown with evidence of testing for sta- tistical significance. So, for example, when a paper reported no difference between patients and controls for some immunolog- ical variables but actual data were not included, we did not include it. Also, if a report compared patient data to normative values rather than to the study’s own control group, we did not include it. The numbers of immunologically active cells and immuno- logically active substances such as cytokines reported in the literature have mushroomed in the past decade. To keep this review manageable, we are reporting scientific papers only on those variables for which either consistent or inconsistent ab- normalities were reported by more than one group. We did not review papers reporting immunological variables to be within normal limits but have listed those studies in which more than one group found such results in a table. We have chosen not to list those variables reported abnormal in only one study be- cause those results have not yet been replicated. When incon- sistent results among laboratories were found for any immu- nological variable, we reviewed the methods described in those papers in an effort to identify reasons for such discrepancies. Note: when a group published more than one paper and it was apparent that the two studies used many if not all of the patients whose data are in the second paper, we chose to include only the more recent paper or the one with the largest number of subjects. To provide several examples, Tirelli pub- lished two papers, the first with 205 subjects and the second with 265 patients (66, 67). When data from one variable ap- peared in both papers, we included data from only the latter. Our own group has published three papers using different statistical methods and making different comparisons when reviewing lymphocyte populations. Thus, we used the one pa- per that controlled for multiple comparisons (74), except in those situations where variables not included in that paper were published elsewhere. Table 1 lists those immune variables that were found to be normal in at least two studies.  INCONSISTENT IMMUNE MARKERS Lymphocyte subsets studied by flow cytometry in cases of CFS developing sporadically. (i) CD2 cells.   Ten papers re- ported data on total numbers of CD2 cells (or of total lym- phocytes), with one reporting decreases (38), a second report- ing decreases for women only (59), and a third reporting an increase in those CD2-labeled cells bearing the activation marker CD26 (26); the remaining seven showed no differences compared to controls (10, 16, 37, 40, 65, 66, 74).  (ii) CD3 cells.   Concerning CD3 cells (i.e., total T cells), seven studies found no differences in the total numbers of these cells (10, 16, 18, 37, 66, 69, 74) while one noted a de- crease (38) and another noted a similar decrease but for women only (59). When data for this marker were expressed as percentages of total lymphocyte count, one reported a de- crease (64) and the remaining nine studies done showed no differences (16, 18, 29, 39, 41, 55, 59, 63, 74).  (iii) CD4 cells.   Concerning CD4 cells (i.e., major histocom- patibility complex class II [MHC II]-restricted T cells), two studies reported abnormalities in cell counts—both showing decreases (38), with one finding this result for women only (59); the remaining eight found no differences (10, 16, 18, 29, 37, 66, 69, 74). One study reported decreases in percentages of CD4 cells relative to total lymphocyte count (63), while ten studies found normal percentages (16, 18, 26, 29, 39, 41, 55, 59, 64, 74).  (iv) CD4/CD8 ratios.   Six studies have reported ratios of CD4 \u0001   to CD8 \u0001   cells. Three of them noted this ratio to be reduced for CFS patients relative to controls (26, 32, 63), while the others found these ratios to be similar to those of controls (28, 29, 59).  (v) CD4 subsets.   A number of studies have evaluated MHC II-restricted T-cell subsets of CFS patients and controls. Of those examining cells expressing CD45RA (i.e., naïve T cells), three reported decreases in the percentage of total T cells * Corresponding author.

Although no single study found differences in CD45RO (Table 1), one report did note increased levels of adhesion markers on these memory T cells (63). Three papers evaluated CD4 cells for the CD54 marker (intercellular adhesion mole- cule 1), with two papers   fi nding the percentages of these cells to be increased (16, 66) and one   fi nding them to be at normal levels (63). Of those papers reporting data on the percentage of CD4 cells bearing the HLA-DR activation marker, one reported an increase (38) and   fi ve found no difference from controls (18, 29, 37, 55, 63).  (vi) CD8 cells.   Eleven papers evaluated absolute numbers of CD8 cells (i.e., MHC-I-restricted T cells), and 10 evaluated these cells as percentages of total T-cell counts. Of the former group of studies, two reported   fi nding decreases (38, 60), with the rest   fi nding normal results (10, 16, 18, 29, 37, 59, 66, 69, 74). Of the latter set of studies, one reported an increase (26) while the rest found no differences (16, 18, 29, 39, 55, 59, 63, 64, 74).  (vii) CD8 subsets.   A number of studies also assessed CD8 cells for the percentage expressing the CD45RA and CD45RO markers. The National Institutes of Health group found nor- mal values for the former (Table 1) but increased values for the latter marker (63), results that two other groups did not   fi nd (18, 55). One activation marker on CD8 cells which has been studied is the CD28 marker; one study reported the percentage of CD8 cells bearing this marker to be reduced (18), and two others found it to be at normal levels (65, 74). A landmark paper in the   Lancet   indicated abnormal numbers of three ac- tivation markers on these CD8 cells (29). A series of papers followed this report. Of those papers reporting data on the percentage   of   CD8   cells   bearing   the   HLA-DR   activation marker (either percentage of CD8 cells or some measure of expression of the subset of cells), three reported increases (26, 29, 38), with six   fi nding no differences from controls (18, 37, 55, 63, 65, 74). Of those additional papers reporting the percent- age of all MHC I-restricted T cells bearing the CD38 marker, one reported an increase (29) while   fi ve found the percentages to be normal (18, 55, 62, 65, 74). Finally,   fi ve papers did a similar determination for CD11b \u0002 : two reported decreases (29, 65) and one reported increase (55), with the remaining  fi nding no differences (63, 74).  (viii) B cells.   Of 11 studies done quantifying the CD19, CD20, or CD21 markers for B cells, two showed increases (26, 66), with the rest showing no differences from controls (10, 16, 18, 29, 39, 59, 63, 69, 74).  (ix) NK cells.   A number of different cell surface markers have been counted to evaluate NK cell number. For the CD3 \u0002 / CD56 \u0001   cells, two studies reported decreases (16, 39) and one reported increases (26), with the remaining three showing nor- mal results (2, 49, 63). For the six reports of CD3-/CD16 \u0001   cell count, three reported decreases (16, 39, 66), with the others all being normal (18, 32, 63). Five papers examined the CD3 \u0002  (CD16 \u0001   and CD56 \u0001 ) cell population: one noted increases (55), and the remaining found no difference from controls (29, 63, 69, 74).  (x) Monocytes.   One group reported the percentage of these cells in whole blood to be increased (3), while four other groups found no difference between patients and controls (28, 40,   59,   69).   Two   groups   have   evaluated   the   presence   of HLA-DR on monocytes: one group noted it to be decreased (57), while another group found it to be at control levels (10).

Implementations of mitochondrial nutrients (MNs) with diet are important for the clinical effects antioxidant. We examined if use of an association of coenzyme Q10 and alpha lipoic acid (Requpero®) could reduce chronic covid symptoms. The Requpero study is a prospective observational study in which 174 patients, who had developed chronic-covid syndrome, were divided in two groups: The first one (116 patients) received coenzyme Q10   +   alpha lipoic acid, and the second one (58 patients) did not receive any treatment. Primary outcome was reduction in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in treatment group compared with control group. complete FSS response was reached most frequently in treatment group than in control group. A FSS complete response was reached in 62 (53.5%) patients in treatment group and in two (3.5%) patients in control group. A reduction in FSS core   <   20% from baseline at T1 (non-response) was observed in 11 patients in the treatment group (9.5%) and in 15 patients in the control group (25.9%) ( p   <   0.0001). To date, this is the first study that tests the efficacy of coenzyme Q10 and alpha lipoic acid in chronic Covid syndrome. Primary and secondary outcomes were met. These results have to be confirmed through a double blind placebo controlled trial of longer duration.

Since then, more than 175 million people worldwide have been infected and over 3.8 million people died for severe ARDS due to interstitial bilateral pneumonia linked to the SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) [1] The most common symptoms of patients with COVID-19 are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia/fatigue [2]. Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported in 33–80% of patients with COVID-19 [3]. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease range from asymptomatic infection to fatal ARDS syndrome [4, 5]. After more than two years, to date, numerous studies have shown that some patients who recovered from COVID-19 develop a chronic post-viral syndrome, characterized by chronic fatigue, variable nonspecific myalgia, depression and sleep disturbances. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental disturbances, chest and joint pain, pal- pitations, dysfunction of smell and taste, cough, headache,  *   Pietro Gatti  pietro.gatti@asl.brindisi.it 1   Internal Medicine Department, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy 2   Epidemiology Unit, ASL Brindisi, Brindisi, Italy 3   Pharmacologist from Officina Speziale, Taranto, Italy\n\nClinical and Experimental Medicine 1 3  and gastrointestinal dysfunction. [6]. All laboratory exami- nations are normal, inflammation markers included. This new entity has been called “Long Covid-19” (other name has been used for this entity, such as “Long COVID- 19,” “post-acute COVID-19,” “persistent COVID-19 symp- toms,” “chronic COVID-19,” “post-COVID-19 manifesta- tions,” “long-term COVID-19 effects,” “post COVID-19 syndrome,” “ongoing COVID-19,” “long-term sequelae,” or “long-haulers” as synonyms [7–9]). Recently, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) defined the stages of SARS-CoV-2 dis- ease in relation to the time of onset of symptoms [10, 11] and proposed the following definition. 1.   Acute COVID-19 infection: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for up to 4 weeks. [11] 2.   Symptomatic COVID-19: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 from 4 to 12 weeks not explained by an alternative diagnosis [11] 3.   Post-COVID-19 syndrome: Signs and symptoms that develop during or following an infection consistent with COVID-19, continue for   >   12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis [11] Long-term symptoms following acute COVID-19 have been observed across the whole spectrum of acute disease severity. These long-term adverse effects of COVID-19 are very similar to those experienced by patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia syndrome [12, 13]. Several studies were conducted in these years to clarify the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mechanisms of cellular damage, both for acute illness and for chronic covid syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [14]. The presence of the ACE-2 receptor in numerous organs and tissues such as the oral and nasal mucosa, lungs, heart, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, spleen, brain, and arte- rial and venous endothelial cells is linked to the cellular damage of the COVID-19 virus to different organs and tis- sues [15, 16] Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 replicates and matures. Activation of immune response results in an inflam- matory response that ends in the recruitment of inflamma- tory cells and the release of cytokines [17]. The COVID-19 cytokine storm (overproduction of   >   150 inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators released by immune or nonimmune cells) [18] determines rapid prolif- eration and hyperactivation of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells. Oxidative stress is also recognized as a major pathoge- netic factor in several viral infections. The main role of mitochondria is to supply cells with energy. The main role of mitochondria is to supply cells with energy, Inflammation related to COVID-19 could lead to a decrease in the synthesis of ATP. Inefficient of ATP synthesis as well as dysregulation in fatty acid and amino acid metabolism have been sug- gested to be also implicated in CFS pathogenesis [19] The anti-inflammatory properties of mitochondrial nutrients (MNs) are well documented in the literature [20, 21]. The dietary implementation of MNs seems to prevent the uncontrolled production of mitochondrial reactive oxy- gen species (mtROS), responsible of mitochondrial dam- age and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent reviews have been focused on the potential clini- cal effects of dietary implementations with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) [22, 23] and α-lipoic acid (ALA) [24, 25]. They have different and complementary roles in mitochondrial function, associated with a strong antioxidant actions. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10- ubiquinone), characterized by a side chain consisting of ten isoprenoid units, is an integral component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [26] and a gene expression modulator [27]. CoQ10 is also introduced through the diet. These properties inspired its use in clinical practice as food supplement. Levels of CoQ10 can decrease both in acute and chronic illness lead- ing to a decreased cellular energy production and to free radical overproduction. As dietary supplement, CoQ10 has low toxicity and does not induce serious adverse effects in humans [28, 29]. As documented by Cordero and col- leagues, the inflammasome complex activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines are implicated in the patho- physiology of fibromyalgia. This activation is mediated by CoQ10 deficiency and oral CoQ10 treatment reduces inflammasome activity. [30] α-lipoic acid (ALA) is a powerful endogenous and exog- enous antioxidant. The active metabolite is represented by its reduced form (dihydrolipoic acid). ALA is part of Krebs cycle, as a co-factor of mitochondrial enzymes [31, 32]. Its dietary supplementation is safety [33]. Its antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity has been well studied. ALA regulates several processes, such as nucleic acid synthesis and ATP production, via the citric acid cycle [34]. As recently summarized [35], ALA has been tested in several chronic disease correlated to immunoinflammatory conditions like metabolic syndrome and diabetic neuropa- thy. Additionally, an antiviral effect has been postulated, suggesting its clinical use for co-treatment of several viral infections. ALA acting as a free radical scavenger and co-factor of ATP production, so that could modulate the course of an infection. Moreover, a recent study by Sadeghiyan Galeshkal- ami et al. [34] reported the benefits of ALA and coQ10\n\nClinical and Experimental Medicine 1 3  combination on experimental diabetic neuropathy by modu- lating oxidative stress and apoptosis. These pharmacological properties suggested us to use ALA via dietary implementation in patients with, acting as booster of CoQ10. The combined use of these two therapeutic agents could provide a synergic effect in treatment of chronic covid syn- drome, increasing energy production and reducing cellular oxidative stress. Given these assumptions, we decided to investigate whether the use of coenzyme Q10 and alpha lipoic acid could reduce chronic covid symptoms.

The study was conducted on over 1,700 patients discharged between January and May from Wuhan, the Chinese city that hosted the first outbreak of the pandemic. After 6 months from the acute phase of the infection, a proportion of patients, ranging from 60 to 80% [9–11], con- tinued to live with at least one symptom related to the dis- ease, mostly fatigue, muscle weakness, but also depression, anxiety and insomnia and other constitutional symptoms. Some patients developed visible pulmonary damage or, for example, renal dysfunctions, but the most frequent symp- tom was the so-called fatigue, conditioning severe limita- tions in activities of daily living. After acute phase, 63% of patients suffered from it. 26% developed sleep disturbances and 23% experience anxiety or depression. These symptoms are described also in chronic fatigue syndrome (also called myalgic encephalomyelitis) [13]. This syndrome is also described among the possible seque- lae of other infectious diseases, such as SARS coronavirus [42], Epstein-Barr virus [43–45], enteroviruses [46], human herpesvirus-6 [47], Ebola virus [46], West Nile virus [48], Dengue virus [49], parvovirus [50]; Borrelia burgdorferi [51], Coxiella burnetii [52], Mycoplasma pneumoniae [53], Giardia lamblia [54]. Many study groups compared long covid syndrome with chronic fatigue syndrome. More patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 disease may develop a “post-viral syndrome which is strikingly similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome [46]”. The lack of a known etiology or pathophysiology, the variability of symptoms, the lack of clear physical signs, the normality of laboratory tests, the association with anxiety and depression, have all contributed to the social stigma of ME/CFS. [46]. It has often been called an “invisible dis- ease”, as patients may appear healthy, when, in reality, they are seriously ill. In the comparison between long Covid syndrome and ME/CFS, the only difference is that chronic fatigue syn- drome, to be diagnosed, requires the persistence of the symptoms described above for at least 6 months, while the  Table   5   Percentage of responders, partial responders and non-responders for each outcome measure (comparison between groups) Score   Control group   Treatment group   All patients   p value FSS; n (%) Non-responders   15 (25.9)   11 (9.5)   26 (14.9)   <0.0001 Partial responders   41 (70.6)   43 (37.0)   84 (48.3) Responders   2 (3.5)   62 (53.5)   64 (36.8) VAS fatigue; n (%) Non-responders   19 (32.8)   14 (12.0)   33 (19.0)   <0.0001 Partial responders   34 (58.6)   35 (30.2)   69 (39.7) Responders   5 (8.6)   67 (57.8)   72 (41.3) VAS pain; n (%) Non-responders   33 (56.9)   19 (16.4)   52 (29.9)   <0.0001 Partial responders   25 (43.1)   37 (31.9)   62 (35.6) Responders   0 (0.0)   60 (51.7)   60 (34.5) VAS sleep; n (%) Non-responders   19 (32.8)   11 (9.5)   30 (17.2)   <0.0001 Partial responders   34 (58.6)   32 (27.6)   66 (37.9) Responders   5 (8.6)   73 (62.9)   78 (44.9) WPI; n (%) Non-responders   24 (41.4)   13 (11.2)   37 (21.2)   <0.0001 Partial responders   29 (50.0)   16 (13.8)   45 (25.9) Responders   5 (8.6)   87 (75.0)   92 (52.9) FAS; n (%) Non-responders   22 (37.9)   6 (5.2)   28 (16.1)   <0.0001 Partial responders   34 (58.6)   26 (22.4)   60 (34.5) Responders   2 (3.5)   84 (72.4)   86 (29.4) SSS; n (%) Non-responders   9 (15.5)   9 (7.8)   18 (10.3)   <0.0001 Partial responders   44 (75.9)   19 (16.4)   63 (36.2) Responders   5 (8.6)   88 (75.8)   93 (53.5)",

The pathomechanisms underlying this illness are not fully understood and the search for a biomarker con‑ tinues, mitochondrial aberrations have been suggested as a possible candidate. The aim of this systematic review is to collate and appraise current literature on mitochondrial changes in ME/CFS/SEID patients compared to healthy controls.  Methods:   Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Medline (EBSCO host) were systematically searched for articles assessing mitochondrial changes in ME/CFS/SEID patients compared to healthy controls published between January 1995 and February 2020. The list of articles was further refined using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality and bias were measured using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Control Studies.  Results:   Nineteen studies were included in this review. The included studies investigated mitochondrial structural and functional differences in ME/CFS/SEID patients compared with healthy controls. Outcomes addressed by the papers include changes in mitochondrial structure, deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleic acid, respiratory function, metabolites, and coenzymes.  Conclusion:   Based on the included articles in the review it is difficult to establish the role of mitochondria in the pathomechanisms of ME/CFS/SEID due to inconsistencies across the studies. Future well ‑ designed studies using the same ME/CFS/SEID diagnostic criteria and analysis methods are required to determine possible   mitochondrial involve‑ ment in the pathomechanisms of ME/CFS/SEID.

Background  Myalgic   Encephalomyelitis/Chronic   Fatigue   Syndrome (ME/CFS),   more   recently   termed   Systemic   Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID) is a complex multidimen- sional illness where patients present with a variety of pathophysiological symptoms including immunological, endocrine and neurological disruption [1–4]. Symptom  Open Access  Journal of Translational Medicine  *Correspondence: ncned@griffith.edu.au 1   National Centre for   Neuroimmunology and   Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nPage 2 of 16 Holden   et al. J Transl Med   (2020) 18:290  presentation   is   heterogeneous   ranging   from   mild   to severe, even leaving some patients bed bound [1]. The underlying   pathomechanisms   of   ME/CFS/SEID   are nebulous and the search for standardised biomarkers continues, so diagnosis entirely depends upon symptom specific case criteria following the exclusion of any other explanatory diagnosis [1–4]. There are four main criteria used to diagnose ME/CFS/ SEID: the 1994 Fukuda Criteria (FC), 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC), 2011 International Consensus Criteria (ICC), and 2015 Institute of Medicine Criteria (IOMC). The FC, CCC, ICC and IOMC all specify fatigue as the cardinal symptom [1–4]. As fatigue is a key diag- nostic symptom for ME/CFS/SEID, energy metabolism may be a significant pathomechanistic factor. Mitochon- drial function is an important aspect of energy metabo- lism and has been the focus of recent study [5–23]. Mitochondria are maternally inherited multifunctional organelles that play a critical role in energy harvesting, transformation and storage as well as other intracel- lular signaling processes [24]. Residing within the inner mitochondrial membrane is the electron transport chain (ETC). The ETC consists of five multi-subunit enzyme complexes (complexes I through V) and two electron carriers:   coenzyme   Q10   (CoQ   10 )   and   cytochrome   c which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [24]. Mitochondria are also fundamental for immune processes such as inflammasome activation and gen- eral intracellular calcium signaling [25, 26]. Due to their physiological importance, mitochondria are implicated in a wide variety of pathological conditions including ME/ CFS/SEID [5–23]. The aim of this systematic review is to present and appraise current research that has compared ME/CFS/ SEID patient participants to healthy control (HC) partici- pants and the role mitochondria may have in ME/CFS/ SEID pathology. Foci include variations in mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic   acid   (mtDNA),   messenger   ribonu- cleic acid (mRNA), mitochondrial respiratory function, metabolites, and coenzymes. [5–23]. Literature on this topic will help guide prospective studies in the search for an appropriate biomarker for this debilitating illness.  Methods  Literature search  This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Fig. 1) and Cochrane guide- lines. PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines were used to ensure international standards were maintained and used for reporting information contained in this systematic review. The databases EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Medline   (EBSCO   host)   were   systematically   searched using full-text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Mitochondrial search terms and ME/CFS/SEID search terms are presented in Table 1. Boolean operators ‘OR’ and ‘AND’ were used to expand the search to include all relevant key terms and to specify articles containing both a ME/CFS/SEID search term and a   mitochondrial search term. Full code can be found in Additional File 1. Literature searches were conducted independently by authors SH and RM on February 18th, 2020. Reference list checking and citation searching was carried out, no additional papers were found. Unpublished literature was not searched. No additional papers were identified in the final search or through alternative databases such as Grif- fith University institute library or Google Scholar.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Studies were included for review if at least one mitochon- drial search term AND at least one ME/CFS/SEID search term (Table 1) were found in the title or abstract and the study complied with the following inclusion criteria: (i) published after 1994 (ii) research conducted on human participants only, aged 18 years or older; (iii) full- text article was available in the English language; (iv) origi- nal research only was reported; (v) ME/CFS/SEID was diagnosed using: FC (1994), CCC (2003), ICC (2011) or IOMC (2015); (vi) investigation was conducted on mito- chondrial aberrations in ME/CFS/SEID patients com- pared to a HC group. Articles that did not contain at least one mitochondrial search term AND at least one ME/CFS/SEID search term in the title or abstract were excluded from the review (Table 1). Articles were excluded if any of the following applied: (i) written prior to the introduction of the FC on December 15th 1994 (all studies 1994 or earlier were excluded considering time was required to be aware of the FC); (ii) conducted in non-human participants or those under the age of 18; (iii) articles not written in Eng- lish or not available as full-text; (iv) studies that reported on non-original data including: duplicate studies, case reports or review articles; (v) use of criteria other than FC, CCC, ICC or IOMC; (vi) Comparison with a patient group (e.g.,) fibromyalgia or depression, without compar- ison to HC participants; (vii) studies that were not within the scope of this review.  Selection of studies  Following retrieval of articles from the databases all articles were stored in the reference management soft- ware package Endnote X9.2. Duplicates were manually removed and all articles that did not contain the listed key words in title or abstract were omitted. The remain- ing articles were reviewed and those that followed the\n\nPage 3 of 16 Holden   et al. J Transl Med   (2020) 18:290  eligibility criteria were selected.

Komaroff, 9   W. Ian Lipkin 1,2,10  Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an unexplained incapacitating illness that may affect up to 4 million people in the United States alone. There are no validated laboratory tests for diagnosis or management despite global efforts to find biomarkers of disease. We considered the possibility that inability to identify such biomarkers reflected variations in diagnostic criteria and laboratory methods as well as the timing of sample collection during the course of the illness. Accordingly, we leveraged two large, multicenter cohort studies of ME/CFS to assess the relationship of immune signatures with diagnosis, illness duration, and other clinical varia- bles. Controls were frequency-matched on key variables known to affect immune status, including season of sampling and geographic site, in addition to age and sex. We report here distinct alterations in plasma immune signatures early in the course of ME/CFS ( n   = 52) relative to healthy controls ( n   = 348) that are not present in subjects with longer duration of illness ( n   = 246). Analyses based on disease duration revealed that early ME/CFS cases had a prominent activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as dissociation of intercytokine regulatory networks. We found a stronger correlation of cytokine alterations with illness duration than with mea- sures of illness severity, suggesting that the immunopathology of ME/CFS is not static. These findings have critical implications for discovery of interventional strategies and early diagnosis of ME/CFS.  INTRODUCTION  Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a dis- abling disorder with complex features that can include fatigue, mem- ory and concentration deficits, sleep disturbances, headache, joint and muscle pain, postexertional malaise, and gastrointestinal and immune system dysfunction ( 1 – 5 ), lasting for 6 months or more. Elderly patients with ME/CFS are at increased risk for non-Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma ( 6 ). The diagnosis of ME/CFS is largely based on recognition of signs and symptoms by experienced clinicians ( 1 ). Although laboratory assays play a role in the diagnostic process, they are used to rule out other con- ditions that can mimic aspects of ME/CFS, rather than as biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis. Efforts to identify immune biomarkers in ME/CFS have produced inconsistent results ( 1 ,   7 – 9 ). Inconsistencies may reflect variations in the use of diagnostic criteria or laboratory methods as well as the timing of sample collection during the course of the illness ( 10 ). To better control for heterogeneity across patients and sampling strategies, in the present study we leveraged the clinical databases and biological specimen repositories of two recent, large, multicenter cohort studies of ME/CFS to assess the relationship of immune signatures (51 cytokines) with diagnosis and other clinical variables: (i) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study, initially developed to address a specific hypothesis regarding infectious exposure ( 11 ) and (ii) the Chronic Fatigue Initiative (CFI) cohort study ( 12 ). Controls were frequency-matched on key variables known to affect immune status, including season of sampling and geographic site, in addition to age and sex. We investi- gated the relationship of diagnosis and clinical phenotype to immune profiles derived from plasma samples collected at the same time of day under controlled conditions of a mild stressor (defined as completion of study forms and procedures for the ME/CFS study population) ( 13 ).  RESULTS  Table 1 shows the demographic features of the study group, including 52 subjects with short-duration illness ( ≤ 3 years), 246 subjects with long-duration illness (>3 years) (total of 298 cases), and 348 controls. For ME/CFS cases participating in both the NIH and the CFI cohort studies, only the clinical and laboratory data obtained during partici- pation in the earlier NIH study were included in the analyses (the num- ber of control subjects is greater than that of cases because the NIH and CFI control groups have no overlap). As anticipated, subjects with more recent onset of illness were younger (40.5 ± 13.6 years) than ME/CFS cases with a long duration of illness (50.2 ± 11.4 years, in comparison with the short-duration group,   P   < 0.0001) as well as in comparison to controls (48.5 ± 12.0 years,   P   < 0.0001). Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) mental fatigue subscale scores in the short- and long-duration ME/CFS groups were, as expected, both higher than in the control group ( P   < 0.0001), but did not differ significantly from each other.  Cases versus controls  General linear model (GLM) and   t -test follow-up comparison of all ME/CFS cases (short and long duration combined,   n   = 298) with controls ( n   = 348) yielded few significant results, with cases showing lower levels for most analytes (tables S1 to S3). Cases had lower  1 Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY 10032, USA.   2 Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY 10032, USA.   3 Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.   4 Institute for Neuro-Immune Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Nova   Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33314, USA, and Miami VA Medical Center, Miami, FL 33125, USA.   5 Levine Clinic, New York, NY 10021, USA.   6 Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.   7 Fatigue Consultation Clinic, Salt Lake City, UT 84102, USA.   8 Sierra Internal Medicine at Incline Village, Incline Village, NV 89451, USA.   9 Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.   10 Departments of Neurology and Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. *Corresponding author.

Recent Findings   The recent World Health Organization clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition requires a his- tory of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms starting within 3 months of the onset of COVID-19. Symptoms must last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms of the post-COVID-19 condition include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms generally have an impact on everyday functioning. The incidence of prolonged symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection has proven challenging to define, but it is now clear that those with relatively mild initial infections, without severe initial respiratory disease or end-organ injury, can still develop chronic impairments, with symptoms that overlap with con- ditions like ME/CFS (profound fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and orthostatic intolerance).  Summary   We do not yet have a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which individuals develop post-COVID-19 condi- tions. There may be several distinct types of long COVID that require different treatments. At this point, there is no single pharmacologic agent to effectively treat all symptoms. Because some presentations of post-COVID-19 conditions mimic disorders such as ME/CFS, treatment guidelines for this and related conditions can be helpful for managing post-COVID-19 symptoms.

Some of these conditions are sequelae of more severe acute COVID-19 such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, post-ICU syndrome, myo- carditis, thrombosis, renal injury, stroke, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Sequelae of MIS-C and the more organ-specific complications have been discussed elsewhere [3–5, 6   •   ]. The focus of this review is on adolescents who have developed long-term symptoms, including those with mild respiratory or systemic illnesses in the acute phase. These individuals have been described as having post-COVID-19 conditions, also referred to as long COVID [7   •   ]. In this paper, we review proposed definitions of post-COVID-19 chronic conditions, discuss the epide- miology of pediatric long COVID, and the overlaps with orthostatic intolerance and other post-infectious illnesses like myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Based largely on our experience treating these overlapping conditions, we offer preliminary recommenda- tions on management.  Search Strategy  In addition to papers and materials known to the authors, we conducted a search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, World Health Organization (WHO) COVID database (which con- tains preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv), and I Love Evi- dence. The search was conducted in mid-November 2021 and used multiple methods of identifying pediatric and adolescent articles, along with various synonyms for long COVID or post-COVID conditions (described in detail in Supplemental File 1).  Definitions  Definitions for post-COVID conditions and other disorders discussed in this review can be found in Table 1. We will use the terms post-COVID-19 condition, post-COVID condi- tions, and long COVID interchangeably throughout.  Long COVID Symptoms  Long COVID is a spectrum of disease, likely with multifac- torial etiologies. Children and adolescents with long COVID are presenting with a variety of complaints, although some patterns are beginning to emerge. Long COVID symptoms can occur in hospitalized [8, 9] or non-hospitalized children [10, 11   •   , 12]. As in adults, many pediatric patients present with symptoms of long COVID after experiencing only mild or asymptomatic acute infections [11   •   , 12]. The time course and constellation of symptoms may vary in adults and children with long COVID. As acknowledged in the WHO definition, some have persistent symptoms that linger after an acute infection, while others develop new or a relapse of symptoms after complete recovery from the initial infection [13   •   , 14]. Some of the fluctuation in symp- tom frequency and intensity may relate to post-exertional exacerbation in symptoms (discussed below). The literature describing pediatric long COVID remains sparse [15, 16], and there is a lack of consistency in how symptoms are elic- ited. Additional studies are needed to clarify the nature and duration of long COVID symptoms in pediatric populations. Fatigue or low energy is one of the most common symp- toms reported in children with long COVID, with recent studies suggesting that up to 87% of affected children report fatigue [10, 11   •   , 14, 17   •   , 18–22, 23   ••   ]. Fatigue in this population often leads to difficulty with physical and cognitive activity, which can limit participation in school, extracurricular activities, and sports. Excessive sleep, problems initiating or maintaining sleep, or non- refreshing sleep often accompany fatigue in pediatric long COVID. Fatigue may persist even with an improve- ment in sleep patterns. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is also common in long COVID. PEM refers to an exacerbation not just of fatigue, but of many symptoms, including lightheadedness, cogni- tive fogginess, sensory sensitivity, headaches, and pain, occurring after relative increases in physical activity or cognitive demands. Orthostatic stress and neuromuscu- lar strain are additional triggers of PEM in ME/CFS and may also be capable of causing symptom exacerbations in long COVID [24, 25]. Sometimes typical activities of daily life like participation in a full day of school can lead to substantial PEM, thereby contributing to functional impairment and distress in these patients. Cognitive difficulties or “brain fog” are also commonly reported by children with long COVID [10, 11   •   , 18, 19, 21, 23   ••   ]. Cognitive difficulties, while inconsistently ascertained in the literature, tend to include problems with concentration, short-term memory, and school per- formance [10, 11   •   , 17   •   , 18, 23   ••   ]. Similar to physical fatigue and PEM, cognitive difficulties or “brain fog” can also be exacerbated by mental exertion, such as school- work or studying for examinations. Headaches are also commonly reported both in the acute and post-acute phase of COVID in children [10, 11 • , 17 • , 19–22, 23   ••   , 26]. Additional studies are needed to char- acterize the nature and specific types of headaches expe- rienced, as well as the best treatment options. Patients with a history of headaches prior to COVID infection may develop more severe or more frequent headaches, but these can arise as a new symptom. Headaches usually  32   Current Pediatrics Reports (2022) 10:31–44\n\n1 3 Table   1   Definitions for post-COVID condition and related disorders Post-COVID-19 Condition  WHO   In October 2021, the WHO published a clinical case definition of the post-COVID-19 condition [2••], following a Delphi consensus pro- cess that included patients, patient researchers, external experts, WHO staff, and others. According to this case definition, the post-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or con- firmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually within 3 months of the onset of COVID-19. Symptoms must last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms of the post- COVID-19 condition include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms may follow an initial recovery period or persist from the initial COVID-19 infection and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Other groups have used a variable duration of prolonged symptoms, commonly 1 month  CDC   The CDC presents post-COVID conditions as the failure to return to a previous state of health following a SARS-CoV-2 infection [7•].

The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of interferon-β to determine its efficacy among moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients.  Methods   A systematic literature search was done using relevant terms for ‘COVID-19’ and ‘interferon-β’. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of interferon-β in COVID-19 were included. Data were extracted for outcome measures, namely mortality, time to clinical improvement and length of hospital stay. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using RevMan V.5.4.1 to calculate overall effect estimate as odds ratio/hazard ratio for categorical variables and mean difference for continuous variable.  Result   Eight RCTs were eligible for qualitative synthesis and seven for meta-analysis. The overall effect estimate (odds ratio [OR] 0.59; 95 % CI 0.91, 1.12) and (mean difference [MD] − 1.41; 95 % CI − 2.84, 0.02) indicated no statistically significant difference between effect of IFN-β and that of control on mortality and length of hospital stay, respectively. However, the overall effect estimate (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95; 95 % CI 1.36, 2.79) denoted a favourable effect of INF-β on reducing the time to clinical improvement in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients.  Conclusion   Addition of interferon-β to standard of care resulted in significant reduction in time to clinical improvement but no significant benefit in terms of reduction in mortality and length of hospital stay in moderate-to-severe cases of COVID-19.  *   Vikas Maharshi  vikas.maharshi81@gmail.com 1   All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Deoghar, India  Key Points  Many anti-viral agents, including interferon-β, have been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19. There are limited data on the effect of interferon-β on outcome of COVID-19 in moderate-to-severe cases. This systematic review and meta-analysis included all the available randomised clinical trials and evaluated the effect of interferon-β on outcome of COVID-19 in moderate-to-severe cases. Interferon-β significantly reduced the time to clinical improvement but did not affect mortality and length of hospital stay outcomes as compared to standard of care.  1   Introduction  Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), the causative factor for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), like SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is a member of the beta   Coronaviridae   family of Coronaviruses [1]. COVID-19 pandemic has affected approximately 235 million individu- als, resulting in more than four million fatalities, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [2]. Symptoms of the disease may range from fever, cough, sore throat and rhinor- rhoea to severe pneumonia and septic shock. A few patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and pos- sible mortality in a significant proportion of patients [3, 4]. Despite great efforts across the world to find potential thera- peutic agents, a handful of the medicines have been approved for emergency use, and none has been accepted globally as definitive treatment of this disease. Therefore, search for effec- tive pharmacotherapy against COVID-19 is still ongoing. Lit- erature suggests that COVID-19 severity may correlate with\n\n1038   S. Kumar et al.  interferon-beta (IFN-β) levels in the body [5]. Interferons are well known for their antiviral as well as immunomodulatory properties. These are classified as type I, II and III IFNs. Type I IFNs are IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ω, IFN-κ and IFN-τ [6–8]. Type I IFNs have been found to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells in vitro assay, viral antigen expression, viral load reduction and plaque reduction assays [9]. Furthermore, IFN- β1b has been shown to have potential to reduce virus-induced lung fibrosis in a mouse model, which could be advantageous for COVID-19 patients with ARDS [10]. It has been found that SARS-CoV-2 could prevent IFN production by such mecha- nisms as escaping from recognition by pattern recognition receptors [11, 12], interfering with retinoic acid-inducible gene I or toll-like receptor signalling [13] and inhibiting phospho- rylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and its activation [14]. Because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory properties, IFN-β has been and is being investigated for management of COVID-19, especially the severe form of the disease. Variable results of treatment with IFN on COVID-19 have been found in clinical trials; therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was planned. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to assess the effect(s) of IFN-β therapy in moderate-to-severe cases of COVID-19 in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay (LOHS) and time to clinical improvement, to help make decisions regarding selection of this drug as a therapeutic option for treatment of this disease.  2   Materials and Methods  2.1   Literature Search Strategy  Literature search was done in PubMed/MedLine, Google Scholar, EMBASE and SCOPUS. PubMed search was performed using terms namely ‘Coronavirus Infection’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2’ in combination with ‘Interferon beta’, ‘Interferon β’ and ‘IFN-β’. Search in Google scholar, EMBASE and SCOPUS was made using keyword ‘Inter- feron beta for COVID-19’. Last search was made on July 31, 2021. This review was registered with PROSPERO (registra- tion number CRD42021262804).  2.2   Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  Randomised controlled trials (published up to July 2021) comparing efficacy of IFN-β to that of standard of care in terms of mortality, LOHS, and/or time to clinical improve- ment, were included. Studies with significant inconsistency between experimental and control groups and studies with use of IFN-beta in experimental as well as in control study arms, were excluded from meta-analysis (Table 1).  2.3   Data Extraction and Quality Assessment  Two reviewers screened the search results with titles and abstracts to find eligible studies. Then the full text of initially screened studies was accessed and data from intervention and control group were recorded in Microsoft Excel. The main data fields were authors, year of publication, trial iden- tifier, study design, population, sample size, intervention(s), comparator(s), dosage and outcome(s) measured. The qual- ity of each study was evaluated independently by ‘Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool version 2’ (RoB 2), which had the facility to assess for randomisation, allocation conceal- ment, blinding, completeness and other sources of bias(es). The response options for each risk of bias judgement were low risk, some concern and high risk of bias.  2.4   Outcome Indicators  The eligible studies included hospitalised patients with mod- erate-to-severe COVID-19. The outcome parameters of this systematic review and meta-analysis were: (1) hospital mor- tality, measured in terms of proportion of participants dying between days 14–28 days (duration of study), (2) LOHS, number of days spent by participants in the hospital from the day of admission up to the day of their discharge and (3) time to clinical improvement, defined as time in terms of days required for improvement of score at least by ‘2’ points on an ordinal scale, namely National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) scale [15] and/or WHO clinical progres- sion scale [16].  2.5   Statistical Analysis  Data were entered into the Microsoft Excel. Meta-analyses were done using the software ‘Review Manager (RevMan)’ version 5.4.1 using random effect model. Relevant summary measures of efficacy were assessed using the odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR) and/or mean difference (MD) for applicable variables along with corresponding 95 % confi- dence interval (CI). Cochrane ‘ Q ’ statistic was applied for statistical heterogeneity, which was quantified using the   I 2 statistic.   I 2   value below 30 was considered as ‘low’, 30–59 as ‘moderate’, 60–74 as ‘substantial’ and ≥ 75 as consider- able heterogeneity. A   p   value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.  3   Results  The initial search identified 1338 potential citations, of which 65 records were screened and the rest were excluded by looking into the titles and/or abstracts. Twenty-four\n\n1039 E cacy of Interferon-\u001e in Moderate-to-Severe Covid - 19  records were found to be original research articles and were assessed for eligibility. Of these 24 studies, 16 were excluded as they were either nonclinical or non-randomised studies. The remaining eight studies [10, 16–22] were included in qualitative synthesis (systematic review), but one study [22] was excluded from meta-analysis as it used IFN in experi- mental as well as in the control arm. All seven of the remain- ing articles were included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1).  3.1   Outcome Parameters  3.1.1   Mortality  In all the seven studies included in meta-analysis, mortality was one of the study outcomes. One of the included studies [10] did not find death in any of the study arms; however, it has been retained in the analysis as mortality as an outcome was evaluated in this study. Random effect model was used for meta-analysis. Number of events was put in the software and calculated odds r",

Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness The   National Academy of Sciences   is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society  of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to  the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare.  Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Acad -  emy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific  and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the National Academy  of Sciences.  The   National Academy of Engineering   was established in 1964, under the charter  of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding en -  gineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members,  sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the  federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineer -  ing programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research,  and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. C. D. Mote, Jr., is presi -  dent of the National Academy of Engineering.  The   Institute of Medicine   was established in 1970 by the National Academy of  Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in  the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Insti -  tute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its  congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own  initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Victor J.  Dzau is president of the Institute of Medicine.  The   National Research Council   was organized by the National Academy of Sci -  ences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the  Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government.  Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the  Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy  of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to  the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The  Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine.  Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone and Dr. C. D. Mote, Jr., are chair and vice chair, respectively,  of the National Research Council.  www.national-academies.org\n\nCopyright © National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

In British Columbia,   Patients were followed up for 18 months.   There were 5 multidisciplinary clinics  involved in care, education and research. Patients had many symptoms. 10% of the Long Cov i d  patients were diagnosed with ME/CFS. Teaching tools for man agement were developed, and this  was available on their website.  At Stanford, 300 patients were enrolled in the Long Covid clinic .   There was a wide age range.  Patients had many symptoms, particularly fatigue, post - exertional malaise and brain fog. Many  s truggled to care for themselves   and avoided many daily activities.  The mean age was 47, and nearly half had a high BMI. 50% of the patients had comorbidities. The  illness was more common in females, and after 6 months, there was still a wide range of symp toms.  It was noted that 2% of the population in the UK is getting Long Covid.  The immune system was described as “haywire”. Minute blood clots were found and there was  evidence of viral persistence. Covid was associated with dysautonomia in 50% of the p atients.  Recommendations were to pace very carefully from the very beginning of the illness. There is a  need to educate GPs and support groups have proved useful.  DYSAUTONOMIA WORKSHOP  Report by Dr Sarah Dalziel:  Dysautonoma Workshop Dr Lauren Stiles S tonybrook University  Dysautonomia is an umbrella term for dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.  Damage can be structural (damaged or missing nerves) or functional (nerves are intact but are not  working properly)  There are many causes of dysautonia including diseases such as Parkinsons, Sjogrens, diabetes and  other small fibre neuropathies. Other causes are syndromes such as neurocardiogenic syncope,  POTs, ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, gastroparesis/ IBS , interstitial nephritis  Dysautonomia affects a large number of people  60% of Parkinsons  25% Diabetics\n\n50% Sjogrens  Large number of post covid patients  Autonomic nervous system regulates the function of many organs  It also influences blood volume, CSF   volume, immune function, connective tissue synthesis and  repair, pain perception, glucose metabolism, iron metabolism and gland function  Symptoms predominantly related to an overactivation of the sympathetic system  Orthostatic symptoms -   fainting, lighthea dedness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dyspnoea, chest  pains  Brain fog  GI dysmotility  Dry eyes and mouth  Abnormal sweating  Upper trunk/ facial flushing  Acrocyanotic legs -   purple dusky discolouraton when legs hanging down with delayed cap refill  Coathange r pain  TESTING  Standard and gold standard test is TILT TABLE, partic with ECG and beat to beat BP monitoring  Alternative is 10 minute STAND test -   not as detailed, can have interference of results from venous  valves and muscle pump  Can miss subtle autonomi c defects  Risk fainting  COMPASS score (composite autonomic symptom score) is a symptom score chart.

About   7   year s   ago,  though,   Systrom   began   to   use   it   to   dig   more   deeply   into   people   who   did   not  have   heart   or   lung   problems   but   exhibited   a   mysterious   exercise   intolerance.  •   The   one   overriding   dysfunction   Systrom   sees   in   ME/CFS   –   and   he   has   now  tested   many   people   with   M E/CFS   –   is   something   called   “preload   failure”   which  refers   to   an   inability   to   provide   enough   blood   to   the   heart   for   it   to   fill   properly.  Preload   failure   reduces   cardiac   output   –   and   the   amount   of   blood   provided   to  the   muscles   during   exercise.  •   Two   types   of   preload   failure   are   found:   low - flow   and   hi - flow.   Low - flow   appears  to   be   caused   by   problems   with   the   veins   –   which   carry   most   of   the   blood   in\n\nthe   body   –   from   constricting   enough   to   force   large   amounts   of   blood   back   to  the   heart   during   exercise.  •   In   hi - flow   p atients,   enough   blood   is   getting   back   to   the   heart,   but   the   muscles  aren’t   taking   up   enough   oxygen   when   it   reaches   them   to   fully   power   them.  This   appears   to   be   caused   by   either   a   shunt   that   transfers   arterial   blood   to   the  veins   before   it   reaches   the   muscle s   and/or   by   damage   to   the   mitochondria.  •   After   Systrom   found   mitochondrial   dysfunctions   in   the   muscle   biopsies   of  patients   who   exhibit   problems   with   systemic   oxygen   extraction,   Astellas   –   a  Japanese   firm   –   funded   an   $8   million   clinical   trial   of   a   mitochond rial   enhancer  in   ME/CFS.

First is to cure the condition – as when an antibiotic is prescribed to quickly eradicate an acute infection. Second is to try and modify what is called the underlying disease process – the use of powerful anti-inflamma- tory drugs in rheumatoid arthritis, or the use of antidepressants to treat depression, are good examples. Third is to relieve specific symptoms such as pain or sleep disturbance – something that is often well worth trying in any disease even though the underlying cause of the symptom may not be fully understood. When it comes to using drugs in ME/CFS, there is obviously no curative treatment at present and none on the horizon. The prospect of having a curative treatment will almost certain- ly have to wait until research provides us with more substantial information as to what is really going wrong in this illness. Significant abnormalities have now been identified involving infection, immune system responses, the ner- vous system, muscle and mitochon- drial function, and hormonal control. These are the type of abnormali- ties that can be used as the basis for considering and investigating new forms of treatment which are aimed at modifying the underlying disease process. However, until we gain a much clearer picture of the possible role of disease-modifying drugs in ME/CFS, the main use of drug treatments is going to be for the relief of common symptoms such   as pain, irritable bowel and gastric symptoms and PoTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). Drugs and other approaches that provide symptomatic relief are already covered in separate MEA information leaflets and will not be reviewed here. So what sort of treatments for ME/ CFS have already been assessed and brought into use? How might new drugs be assessed and brought into use? And what sort of new and speculative ME/CFS treatments might become available in the future?  HOW ARE NEW DRUGS ASSESSED AND BROUGHT INTO USE?  Before a drug can be licensed for use in a specific condition like ME/CFS, and then recommended for use by NICE, there must be sound and consistent evidence of both benefit and safety from a number of ‘gold standard’ clinical trials. Such trials are normally carried out in what is termed a randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled manner. In simple terms this means that the patients involved are divided into two matched groups. Each group is then given either a placebo or the active drug. The patients in both groups do not know which they are receiving – neither do the organisers of the trial. They are then assessed over a period of time to record side-effects and to what extent the patients taking the active drug respond in comparison to those taking the placebo. Drug trials are extremely costly to carry out – so the assessment process often starts with small numbers and pilot studies. If the initial results are encouraging, the assessment process progresses to what is called a phase 3 clinical trial – the so-called gold stan- dard of assessment for clinical trials. If one or more phase 3 clinical trials can demonstrate both efficacy and safety, the drug will almost certainly  INTRODUCTION  be given what is called a product license and made available on the NHS. However, as we know from the Ritux- imab clinical trial in Norway, there can be very encouraging signs based on early observations and from small clinical trials.

While it is welcome to note that the recommendation on GET will form part of the re-assessment of evidence for the new NICE guideline, this will not appear until October 2020. And, despite requests by the ME Association to NICE for GET to be removed from the current guidance, there is no indication at present that this will happen. We also require good quality research studies to investigate the role of activity management in ME/CFS in a way that takes account of stage, severity and fluc- tuation of symptoms. These sort of trials also need to include objective outcome measures (eg the use of actometers). Health professionals would then be in a much better position to provide sound guidance on activity management.  ANTIDEPRESSANTS  Low doses of antidepressants – in particular sedating tricyclic drugs such as   amitriptyline   – can sometimes be very useful in relieving pain, improving disrupted sleep patterns, and helping with sensory symptoms. Higher doses over a prolonged period may be necessary when someone with ME/CFS also develops true clinical depression. failed to confirm that Rituximab was an effective treatment for ME/CFS. Clinical trials are clearly important but one of the problems with ME/CFS is that we have a lot of clinical and patho- logical sub-groups under the current umbrella. So a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment is unlikely to work. Consequently, clinical trial analysis must also allow for the fact that there may be a small sub-group responding – even though most of the people involved are not responding.  HOW CAN WE TREAT ME/CFS?  What follows is an A-Z summary of all the treatments – drugs, supplements, vitamins and non -drug approaches – that have been assessed, are being assessed, or could be assessed to see if they could be safe and effective treat- ments for ME/CFS.  ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT: GRADED EXERCISE THERAPY (GET) AND PACING  In our current state of knowledge, activity management – balancing physical, mental and emotional activity with rest in a manner that is appropriate and within a person’s limitations – is the most important aspect of managing ME/CFS. Patient evidence – gained from our very detailed survey of management approaches (www.meassociation.org. uk/2015/05/23959/) – indicates that  pacing   is the safest and most effective form of activity management. Unfortunately, we do not have any results from clinical trials that have properly assessed the benefits of pacing – although several research papers have advocated its use over and above other methods. Conversely,   graded exercise treat- ment   (GET) – currently recommended by NICE for everyone with mild or moderate ME/CFS – has made the con- dition worse in over 50% of people with ME/CFS who were advised to try it. GET is supported by some clinical trials. However, the largest, most influential and most recent trial, the PACE Trial, has been heavily criticised by However, there is no evidence from clinical trials to indicate that any of the antidepressant drugs that are currently in use are an effective form of treatment for ME/CFS. In other words, they have no effect on the underlying disease process and do not restore health and function. One possible exception is the use of a group of antidepressant drugs known as SSRIs (selective serotonin uptake re-inhibitors) –   sertraline   (trade name, Lustral) in particular. This is because there is evidence that a disturbance involving a brain chemical transmitter called serotonin occurs in some people with ME/CFS. Anecdotal evidence indicates that some people with ME/CFS have gained benefit from using sertraline to increase the level of serotonin in the brain. How- ever, we also know that other people with ME/CFS are very sensitive to SSRI medication and feel worse as a result. In other words, a sub-group of people with ME/CFS appear to have low levels of serotonin and might benefit from an SSRI whereas others have normal, or elevated levels of serotonin, and are therefore very sensitive to this type of medication. So the use of an SSRI, even at a very low dose, is an approach that may be worth trying but has to be done very cautiously.\n\n3  u   The ME Association has a leaflet  covering all aspects of depression  and the use of antidepressant  drugs in ME/CFS.  ANTIVIRAL DRUGS  Viral (and sometimes bacterial) infec- tions are a very common trigger factor in the development of ME/CFS. A debate continues as to whether some of these triggering infections (entero- viral infections in particular) may then persist at a cellular level – as happens in the case of HIV or hepatitis C infection – and play a role in causing ME/CFS symptoms. However, the current balance of evidence indicates that persisting viral infection is not involved in the underlying disease process. There is more robust evidence to indicate that some types of dormant viral infection – herpes viruses such as EBV and HHV-6 in particular – become reactivated in ME/CFS. Two antiviral drugs have been assessed so far in clinical trials in people with ME/CFS. A small early trial found no benefits from using   acyclovir   – a drug that is very effective at treating herpes virus infections. However, more recent trials in America carried out by Professor Jose Montoya’s group at Stanford, who use  valganciclovir   (trade name, Valcyte), indicate that this antiviral drug could be of value in carefully selected patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of reactivation of HHV-6 infection. The ME Association followed this up and met with representatives of Roche Pharmaceuticals (who manufacture Valc",

At present, there is no sound evidence of   thyroid gland dysfunction   (ie hypo-thyroidism) in ME/CFS, although a recently published paper has reported on an aspect of thyroid dysfunction where ME/CFS patients had relatively higher levels of another thyroid hormone called “reverse T3” or rT3. This appeared to be due to a shift in hormone production, where the body preferred to convert T4 to rT3 instead of producing T3. The low T3 levels found in ME/CFS patients coupled with this switchover to rT3 could mean that T3 levels are severely reduced in tissue. Some doctors are willing to prescribe thyroid supplements to people with ME/CFS. However, the use of thyroid supplements in people with normal thyroid function tests has potential dangers and cannot be recommended in our current state of knowledge, especially in people who may also have a degree of hypocortisolaemia.  Melatonin   is a naturally occurring hormone that is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. It helps to keep the ‘body clock’ functioning normally, especially in relation to the induction of sleep at night. We know from patient surveys (the most recent being the MEA website survey in October 2017) that a significant number of people with ME/CFS use melatonin to help sleep disturbances, especially when this is more severe. Interestingly, the NICE guideline on ME/CFS allows for the use of melatonin in children – provided it is recommend- ed and supervised by a paediatrician. But NICE makes no such recommenda- tion for adults in the current guideline Consequently, most adults find that doctors are unwilling to prescribe melatonin on the NHS and have to purchase it via the internet – which is not always a safe and reliable source for this type of treatment. The ME Association is currently look- ing at the possibility of setting up a clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of melatonin in adults. The use of   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)   supplements is also unwise. This is because there is no sound evidence of DHEA deficiency in ME/CFS and this hormone has been linked to cancer.  u   The MEA has leaflets covering the  Management of the Menopause  and research into female hormone  status in ME/CFS, Thyroid Function  and Thyroid Function Tests, and  Sleep – the latter includes informa-  tion on Circadin (prescription-only  melatonin).  DRUGS THAT CAN MODIFY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE  Various markers of immune system dysfunction can be found in people with ME/CFS. These include raised levels of cytokines, abnormalities in natural killer (NK) cell function, B- and T-cell function, and the production of autoantibodies – potentially harmful antibodies that are directed against the body’s own tissues, rather than infec- tions and allergens. A popular hypothesis here involves a triggering infection which then results in an on-going abnormality involving the body’s immune defence system. One possibility, supported by recent research evidence, is that there is an on-going over-production of cytokines – chemicals that cause people to feel unwell when they have any type of infective illness. A considerable number of immuno- logical treatments have therefore been assessed as possible forms of treatment for ME/CFS. The list includes Ampligen, immunoglobulin (IgG) injections, alpha interferon, inosine pranobex (trade name Imunovir), rituximab, staphy- lococcus toxoid vaccine and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors.  Ampligen   is a very expensive American drug that is claimed to have both antiviral and immunomodulatory properties. Ampligen has not been ap- proved for use in ME/CFS by the Food and Drug Administration – the US drug regulator – and is unlikely to be made available in the UK until this approval has been given.  Inosine pranobex/Imunovir   is an immunomodulatory drug that has a potential to enhance natural killer cell activity. Anecdotal reports indicate that some people find this drug to be helpful and some specialists are will- ing to prescribe it. Other doctors are generally unwilling to do so in view of the NICE recommendation to not use immunomodulatory drugs in ME/CFS.  Rituximab   (a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody) is an anti-cancer drug that causes depletion of B lymphoctye cells in the body. It was reported to be beneficial in a preliminary trial carried out in Norway but a further large trial failed to confirm these findings.  Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors  are widely used in more severe rheuma- toid arthritis to dampen down inflam- mation in the joints. Preliminary results from a pilot study involving six ME/CFS patients indicated that one drug in this group (etanercept) could be of benefit and needs to be tested in larger clinical trials. Another drug in this group called anakinra has also been assessed in a clinical trial in The Netherlands but there were no significant benefits.",

The three major pathophysiologic mechanisms include partial autonomic neu- ropathy, hypovolemia, and hyperadrenergic state. Patients often will exhibit overlapping characteristics from more than one of these mechanisms. The approach to the treatment of POTS centers on treating the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism. Stockings, abdominal binders, and vasocon- strictors are used to enhance venous return in partial neuropathic POTS. Exercise and volume expansion are the main treatment strategies for hypov- olemic POTS. For hyperadrenergic POTS, beta-blockers and avoidance of norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors is important. Attempts should be made to discern which pathophysiologic mechanism(s) may be afflicting patients so that treatment regimens can be individualized.  4.1 Review in Advance first posted on  August   1 4 , 2019.

These symptoms improve with recumbency, and this phenomenon must persist for at least 3–6 months in the absence of chronic conditions or medications that promote orthostatic intolerance. The severity of the symptoms is highly variable and can run the spectrum of mildly bothersome to outright debilitating (3). Although the exact prevalence of this condition is unknown, POTS has been considered the most common disorder seen in autonomic specialty clinics and is estimated to affect between 0.5–3 million individuals in the United States (4, 5). The majority ( > 90%) of POTS patients are young, white women of childbearing age (2). Though the nature and severity of symptoms widely vary among POTS patients, the   sine qua non   of POTS diagnosis rests on a cardinal hemodynamic finding—an increase in heart rate by at least 30 beats per minute (bpm) on assuming an upright position in the absence of orthostatic hypotension—that was first described in 1988 in a subset of patients with orthostatic intolerance undergoing lower-extremity blood plethysmography studies (6). This is a striking hemodynamic finding that is not psychogenic (7). Despite this discovery 30 years ago, an all-inclusive, pathophys- iologic mechanism for this rather prevalent syndrome remains elusive (8). The reason behind this will be explored, along with its implications for the treatment and management of this syndrome.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  POTS should not be considered a disease but a clinical syndrome or phenotype, with the afore- mentioned signs (orthostatic tachycardia) and symptoms that worsen and improve with posture change. Thus far, the literature has identified three different pathophysiologic mechanisms that are capable of manifesting the POTS phenotype: ( a ) partial autonomic neuropathy, ( b ) persistent predilection for hypovolemia, and ( c ) central hyperadrenergic state. These three pathophysiologic mechanisms engender somewhat distinct variants of the POTS phenotype that henceforward will be referred to as endophenotypes (4). While many conditions, such as mast cell activation disor- ders (9), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (10, 11), deconditioning (12), and genetic mutations of nore- pinephrine transporters (13) coexist with POTS, their downstream effects also funnel into these three principal pathophysiologic mechanisms. These three endophenotypes and how they relate to comorbidities commonly observed in POTS are discussed below ( Figure 1 ).  Neuropathic POTS (Partial Autonomic Neuropathy)  There is much evidence in the literature suggesting preferential autonomic neuropathy in certain vascular beds promoting blood stasis in the pelvic, splanchnic, and lower extremities. Stewart et al. (14–17) noted that pediatric patients with POTS had excessive pooling of blood in the lower extremities, primarily due to arteriolar dysregulation rather than inappropriately increased venous capacitance. Jacob et al. (18) demonstrated significantly impaired sympathetic nervous system activity in the lower extremities of POTS patients. Amounts of norepinephrine released at sympathetic nervous system synapses in the lower extremities in response to a cold pressor test, a nitroprusside infusion, and tyramine infusion were markedly lower in POTS pa- tients than in healthy controls. In contrast, the amounts of norepinephrine released in the up- per extremities in response to the same stimuli were no different between POTS patients and healthy controls. Another interesting finding is that POTS patients demonstrate an exaggerated  4.2   Mar   •   Raj Review in Advance first posted on  August   1 4 , 2019.

Three primary endophenotypes of POTS are listed at the top ( gold boxes ) with their respective pathophysiologic mechanisms below ( brown boxes ) leading to signs and symptoms of POTS ( gray box ). The pathophysiology of neuropathic and hypovolemic POTS converges with decreased venous return and reduced stroke volume ( topmost blue box ) before cascading down toward baroreceptor unloading, increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, tachycardia, and altered cerebral perfusion ( subsequent blue boxes ). The pathophysiology of hyperadrenergic POTS merges with the cascade at the increased SNS activity phase. Common comorbidities associated with POTS (deconditioning, autoimmune disorders, and autoantibodies;   green boxes ) are depicted entering the cascade at various entry points, all eventually leading to the POTS phenotype ( gray box ). vasoconstrictive response to locally administered norepinephrine in the lower extremities, sug- gestive of a functionally denervated or depleted postganglionic state at baseline (19). The extent of partial autonomic neuropathy extends beyond the lower extremities into the pelvic and splanchnic circulation. Both Doppler ultrasound and plethysmography studies have demonstrated abnormally increased blood flow and pooling in the splanchnic and pelvic circula- tion of POTS patients both at rest and in an upright position (20–24). Other studies have also demonstrated that POTS patients have significantly greater decreases in thoracic and cerebral blood flow when compared to healthy controls during tilt (21, 23, 25–27). Taken altogether, these observations suggest that excessive blood pooling likely occurs below the level of the thorax in POTS patients when assuming an upright position. The patients with this particular endophenotype of POTS commonly exhibit acrocyanosis, a marked darkening in skin hue with standing. Medow et al.

But there are a number of  pharmacological and non - pharmacological treatments that a   clinician can use to help reduce the  severity of specific symptoms and improve the patient’s quality of life. Depending on a patient’s  presentation and testing, the treatment recommendations below are those used by ME/CFS  clinical experts to treat various   aspects of ME/CFS, such as orthostatic intolerance, sleep  issues, pain, and immune function. Pharmacological treatments begin on page 2 and non -  pharmacological therapies on page 8. Recommendations for supplements are not provided in  this document.  Some d isease experts are evaluating the selective use of antivirals and immune modulators in  ME/CFS and have seen evidence of efficacy in some patients. Double blind randomized  controlled treatment trials are needed to evaluate these therapies. A specialty consu ltation may  be helpful in identifying and treating these or other aspects of the disease.  Some ME/CFS patients have increased intolerance to a variety of medications. In these  patients, drugs should be started at low doses and increased slowly to avoid tr iggering drug  sensitivities common in ME/CFS. Clinicians should also be aware of any potential impact of  ingredients considered to be inactive in medications (e.g. fillers, vehicles, preservatives). For  patients sensitive to drug fillers, the physician mig ht speak with a compounding pharmacy to  determine if a liquid preparation is an alternative.  Comorbidities should also be diagnosed and treated using the published standard of care.  Doing so can also help decrease the symptom burden and improve the patien t’s quality of life.  Recommendations for treatment of comorbidities are not covered in this document.  The treatment recommendations provided here are general ones. In deciding on the specific  treatment approach, the treating physician should consider the   presentation and needs of the  individual patient along with up - to - date drug product information for approved uses, dosages,  and risks of specific treatments for specific indications.

Currently,   ME/CFS   has   no   known   cause,   nor   are   the mechanisms of illness well understood. Therefore, with few exceptions, attempts at treating ME/CFS have been directed mainly towards symptom management. These treatments include antivirals,   pain   relievers,   antidepressants,   and   oncologic   agents   as   well   as   other   single- intervention treatments. Results of these trials have been largely inconclusive and, in some cases, contradictory. Contributing factors include a lack of well-designed and executed studies and the highly heterogeneous nature of ME/CFS, which has made a single etiology difficult to define. Because the majority of single-intervention treatments have shown little efficacy, it may instead be beneficial to explore broader-acting combination therapies where a more focused precision medicine approach is supported by a systems-level analysis of endocrine and immune co-regulation.\n\nIntroduction  The management of complex multi-factorial chronic diseases is often marred by a confluence of partially or entirely ineffectual treatments. Due to the many symptoms displayed by   those   affected,   there   is   very   often   no   single   clear   path   to   treatment   or   symptom management. Myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), is a disease characterized by an inability to exert oneself physically, often coupled with a combination of other symptoms, including sleep disorders, severe unpredictable pain, and compromised   cognitive   abilities.   Those   suffering   from   ME/CFS   experience   prolonged   (six months or greater) periods of exhaustion that is not relieved by rest 1 . The exact etiology of ME/CFS is currently unknown 2   though multiple hypotheses exist regarding potential triggers and mechanisms of illness, including viral infection 3,4 , mitochondrial dysfunction 5 , and neurological abnormalities 6–8 . Ultimately, there may be no single underlying cause for this illness and it is not improbable   that   ME/CFS   may   serve   as   an   umbrella   term   for   multiple   different   diseases associated   with   overlapping   symptoms 9 .   The   diversity   in   symptom   profiles   and   potential etiologies associated with ME/CFS make treatment and management of this illness extremely challenging and a treatment that may be effective for one subset of individuals may not be effective for another. As   a   result   of   this   uncertainty   regarding   the   underlying   mechanisms   of   illness   in ME/CFS, most attempts at pharmacological treatment have focused on reduction in the severity of specific subsets of symptoms. This summary overview delineates a number of the more prominent treatments for ME/CFS into different categories, and evaluates the methods and results of corresponding drug trials (Figure 1). Drugs including pain relievers (both specific and non-specific   non-steroidal   anti-inflammatory   drugs   or   NSAIDS),   antidepressants   (MAO inhibitors, SNRIs, and SSRIs), antivirals, and antihistamines have been identified as possibly beneficial in treating ME/CFS. Though other non-pharmacological approaches to treatment\n\nhave been considered for ME/CFS such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) 10 , we have focused in this overview on pharmaceutical agents only. Antivirals  A   viral   cause for   ME/CFS   has   been long-hypothesized,   and there   is   evidence that   both enteroviruses and herpesviruses may be responsible for ME/CFS, at least in some cases 11,12 . There has been a significant amount of research over the past three decades into the efficacy of antiviral drugs in the treatment of ME/CFS. These treatments generally include two different classes   of   antivirals,   guanosine   analogs   such   as   Acyclovir   and   Valacyclovir,   and   the immunomodulator Rintatolimod (trade name Ampligen). Such treatments have met with varying levels of success in clinical trials on ME/CFS patients. The first study attempting to treat ME/CFS with acyclovir was published in 1988. A placebo-controlled   study of   twenty-four   ME/CFS   patients,   each   given   first   rapid   doses   of intravenous acyclovir for one week, followed by one month of oral administration, found no significant difference in the improvement of individuals between the control and test groups. The study ultimately concluded   that   acyclovir   had no   noticeable effect   on   ME/CFS   patients 13 . However, a 2007 study on valacyclovir, which is metabolized into acyclovir upon administration, found significant improvements in physical activity among 27 ME/CFS patients with elevated Epstein Barr virus (EBV) antibodies 14 . However, treatment methods were altered significantly in those that were not responding to valacyclovir treatment alone, complicating the interpretation of results. Additional drugs, including cimetidine and probenecid, were added to the treatment course in patients not responding within three months of treatment. Furthermore, three patients who   suffered   side-effects   of   valacyclovir   were   placed   on   a   different   guanosine   analog, famciclovir 14 . In addition administration of these drugs was also not performed at consistent intervals, as treatment was withheld when symptoms appeared to improve over a month and only re-administered if patients began to relapse 14 . These confounding variables leave the\n\neffectiveness of valacyclovir/acyclovir in question. A 2013 study by Montoya et al conducted at Stanford University examined another guanosine analog, valganciclovir, in 30 ME/CFS patients who also had elevated serum IgG titers for EBV and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) 15 . This study found statistically significant improvements in cognitive function and reduced mental fatigue in patients   receiving   valganciclovir   as   compared   to   the   placebo,   further   supporting   similar conclusions drawn earlier by the same group in which 75% (9 of 12) patients suffering from viral central   nervous   system   dysfunction   found   “near-resolution   of   their   symptoms”   following treatment with valganciclovir 16 . This study was limited by its small size but provided evidence for continued research by these and other investigators. Rintatolimod,   a   double-stranded   RNA   drug   designed   to   increase   antiviral   immune response via toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation, is one of the only drugs to have been developed with the specific goal of treating ME/CFS 17,18 . A 1995 study by Strayer, et al. found significant improvements in cognitive function and memory, as well as a reduction in HHV-6 mRNA expression, in 15 ME/CFS patients undergoing long-term treatment with rintatolimod 19 . In a second, larger clinical trial of 234 severe ME/CFS patients, results were consistent with the earlier   trial,   though   improvements   were   somewhat   reduced   in   magnitude 20 .   Rintatolimod treatment has been associated with improvements in symptom burden in multiple clinical trials 17 , but has generally not been found to produce stable remission, suggesting that further studies are required. Overall, evidence so far suggests that antiviral drugs appear to show limited efficacy in treating ME/CFS over a broad demographic. Trials of existing antiviral medications either fail outright or tend to be plagued by imperfect study design and/ or low statistical power. Once again, it should be noted that the causes for ME/CFS are likely heterogeneous, meaning that treatments may work in some, but not broadly in all patients. Future trials of antiviral drugs may benefit greatly from careful selection of inclusion criteria for patients, especially with respect to seropositivity for specific viruses.\n\nAnalgesics  Pain   relievers,   both   over-the-counter   and   prescription-only,   are   often   used   to   treat   the generalized body pains and aches associated with ME/CFS. A 2009 review by Boneva, et al. on medication   use by ME/CFS   patients in Georgia found that   pain relievers   were the most commonly used drugs in the ME/CFS group 21 . Sixt",

Collectively, the members of the panel have:  •   diagnosed and/or treated more than 50 000 patients who have ME;  •   more than 500 years of clinical experience;  •   approximately 500 years of teaching experience;  •   authored hundreds of peer-reviewed publications, as well as written chapters and medical books; and  •   several members have co-authored previous criteria.  Panel members contributed their extensive knowledge and experience to the development of the International Consensus Criteria and this Primer.   In addition, an International Symptom Scale will be developed to complement the criteria and promote clearer identification of patients for research studies.  Primer Consensus:   The authors, representing twelve countries, reached 100 % consensus through a Delphi-type process.  International Consensus Criteria (ICC)  Problem  The label ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’ (CFS), coined in the 1980s, has persisted due to lack of knowledge of its etiologic agents and pathophysiology.   Misperceptions have arisen because the name ‘CFS’ and its hybrids ME/CFS, CFS/ME and CFS/CF have been used for widely diverse conditions. Patient sets can include those who are seriously ill with ME, many bedridden and unable to care for themselves, to those who have general fatigue or, under the Reeves criteria, patients are not required to have any physical symptoms. There is a poignant need to untangle the web of confusion caused by mixing diverse and often overly inclusive patient populations in one heterogeneous, multi-rubric pot called ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’.   We believe this is the foremost cause of diluted and inconsistent research findings, which hinders progress, fosters scepticism, and wastes limited research monies.  Solution  The rationale   for the development of the ICC was to utilize current research knowledge to identify objective, measurable and   reproducible   abnormalities   that   directly   reflect   the   interactive,   regulatory   components   of   the   underlying pathophysiology of ME. Specifically, the ICC select patients who exhibit explicit multi-systemic neuropathology, and have a pathological low threshold of physical and mental fatigability in response to exertion.   Cardiopulmonary exercise test- retest studies have confirmed many post-exertional abnormalities.   Criterial symptoms are compulsory and identify patients who have greater physical, cognitive and functional impairments. The ICC advance the successful strategy of the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) of grouping coordinated patterns of symptom clusters that identify areas of pathology. The criteria are designed for both clinical and research settings.  1.   Name:   Myalgic encephalomyelitis,   a name that originated in the 1950s, is the most accurate and appropriate name because it reflects the underlying multi-system pathophysiology of the disease. Our panel strongly recommends that  only   the name ‘myalgic encephalomyelitis’ be used to identify patients meeting the ICC because a distinctive disease entity should have one name. Patients diagnosed using broader or other criteria for CFS or its hybrids (Oxford, Reeves, London, Fukuda, CCC, etc.) should be reassessed with the ICC. Those who fulfill the criteria have ME; those who do not would remain in the more encompassing CFS classification.  2.   Remove patients who satisfy the ICC from the broader category of CFS.   The purpose of diagnosis is to provide clarity. The criterial symptoms, such as the distinctive abnormal responses to exertion can differentiate ME patients from those who are depressed or have other fatiguing conditions.   Not only is it common sense to extricate ME patients from the assortment of conditions assembled under the CFS umbrella, it is compliant with the WHO classification rule that a disease cannot be classified un",

Along with fatigue, patients experience various symptoms, including cognitive  impairments, post-exertional malaise, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and immune system  dysfunction. Diagnosing CFS/ME is challenging due to the absence of definitive biomarkers, the overlap of  symptoms with other conditions, and the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria. This comprehensive  literature review aims to contribute to the understanding of CFS/ME, including its diagnosis,  pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, treatment, and future directions.  Categories:   Rheumatology, Pain Management, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation  Keywords:   center for disease control, chronic fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, general fatigue, international  consensus criteria  Introduction And Background  Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is characterized by severe,  persistent exhaustion that significantly limits daily activities and is not relieved by rest. This fatigue often  worsens with physical or mental exertion and is accompanied by other debilitating symptoms. In addition to  fatigue, individuals may experience a range of symptoms, such as post-exertional malaise, neuro-cognitive  symptoms (confusion or slow thinking), muscle pain, joint pain, sleep disturbances, hypersensitivity to  stimuli, flu-like symptoms, autonomic dysfunction (weakness and tremors), and immune system  abnormalities that are usually made worse by exertion and not better explained by a different underlying  etiology   [1] . CFS/ME is a severe illness that can lead to significant physical impairment, leaving patients  immobile and requiring extensive care. This care may include hospitalizations for acute episodes, home  support for daily activities, and outpatient management involving medications, physical therapy, and  mental health services   [2] . A multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, home health aides, and  family caregivers often provides this care   [2] . Neuro-cognitive deficits, chronic exhaustion, and flu-like  symptoms are some of the disease's hallmarks   [3] . An epidemiological investigation found that about half of  CFS/ME patients are unable to work   [4] . According to prior research, 48% of patients cannot engage in any  constructive activity at their worst, and 87% cannot work   [3] . Following modest physical, orthostatic, and  cognitive exertion, the malaise and its associated symptoms deteriorate markedly, known as post-exertional  malaise (PEM)   [5] . This primary symptom often appears 24 hours after overexertion and causes a  considerable drop in the patient's energy and activity level (at least 50%)   [6] . Other symptoms include  problems with memory and attention, commonly referred to as \"brain fog,” slowed information processing,  difficulty articulating ideas or finding the correct words, inability to multitask or sustain concentration on  activities, short-term memory impairment, and a shorter attention span   [7] . Allergies or sensitivity to any  kind of stimulus, including light, noise, odors, extreme temperature, chemicals, and simple conversations,  are frequent patient complaints   [8] . Patients with severe illness may express an inability to communicate, lie  in bed in the dark, take frequent showers, and the inability to watch TV or listen to music   [2] . Depression,  anxiety, and decreased motivation or interest in previously favored activities are also very common  symptoms   [2] .  Compared to the general population, those with CFS/ME also have a higher risk of suicide   [9] . Multiple risk  factors, including social and cultural elements such as unsupportive interactions, social isolation, and  negative attributions, affect people with CFS/ME. Suicidal thoughts may arise from the condition's effect on  jobs and everyday activities, which may result in feelings of inadequacy and diminished self-worth   [10] .  Another important risk factor for suicide is chronic pain. Furthermore, patient's perceptions of their  condition may change because of unidentified comorbidities, thereby impacting suicidal thoughts   [10] .  Between 836,000 and 2.5 million Americans have been estimated to have CFS/ME, as noted in the 2015 IOM  1   2   3   4   5   6  7   5   5  Open Access Review Article  How to cite this article  Graves B, Patel M, Newgent H, et al. (October 01, 2024) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Future Direction. Cureus 16(10):  e70616.   DOI 10.7759/cureus.70616\n\nreport   [11] . Among the cases identified, less than 20% reported receiving a CFS/ME diagnosis from a  healthcare provider   [12] . Among persons diagnosed with CFS/ME, the ratio of women to men can be as high  as four to one   [12] . CFS/ME is less common in children than in adults but is more prevalent in adolescents  than in younger children   [13] . Diagnosed mostly in people between 40 and 60 years old. CFS/ME occurs in all  ethnic and racial groups   [14] . Factors that may increase the risk of developing CFS/ME include age, sex, and  medical comorbidities   [15] . Young to middle-aged adults and women are most affected. Patients with a  history of other complex medical conditions, such as fibromyalgia or postural orthostatic tachycardia  syndrome, are also at risk.  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant attention to post-viral fatigue syndromes, particularly due  to its association with conditions resembling CFS/ME   [16] . However, the absence of COVID-19 in the  introduction and background of this review is notable, given that ongoing research increasingly links the  virus to the development of CFS/ME-like symptoms. Often referred to as \"long COVID\" or \"post-acute  sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection\" (PASC), this post-infection phenomenon shares many similarities with  CFS/ME, including persistent, debilitating fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive difficulties (\"brain  fog\"), muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction   [16,17] . Studies indicate that up  to 10-30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience long-term symptoms consistent with  CFS/ME, regardless of the severity of the initial illness. This high prevalence points to COVID-19's potential  as a trigger for CFS/ME, similar to other viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, which have historically  been associated with CFS/ME onset   [18] .  The mechanisms by which COVID-19 may lead to a CFS/ME-like condition are an area of active  investigation. One of the proposed mechanisms is immune dysregulation; COVID-19 is known to provoke a  robust inflammatory response, including a cytokine storm, which may lead to persistent immune activation  even after the acute infection has resolved   [16] . This ongoing inflammation could contribute to chronic  fatigue and other symptoms characteristic of CFS/ME   [17] . Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is  another potential link between COVID-19 and CFS/ME. Many long COVID patients exhibit symptoms such as  orthostatic intolerance, irregular heart rate, and blood pressure abnormalities, which mirror autonomic  dysfunction observed in CFS/ME   [18] . Additionally, there is evidence suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction  in long COVID, aligning with similar findings in CFS/ME where impaired mitochondrial energy production  may underlie the profound fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance   [19] .  Another hypothesis centers on viral persistence, suggesting that fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may  remain in the body, continuously triggering an immune response and leading to prolonged symptoms   [20] .  This theory is akin to those proposed for other infections that can precede CFS/ME. Furthermore, SARS-  CoV-2 has been shown to affect the central nervous system, potentially causing neuroinflammation. This  could explain neurological symptoms like cognitive dysfunction and \"brain fog,\" which are hallmark features  of both long COVID and CFS/ME   [20] .  The diagnosis of CFS/ME is challenging due to the absence of definitive biomarkers, the overlap of  symptoms with other conditions, and a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria. The aim of this  comprehensive literature review is to contribute to the understanding of CFS/ME, including its diagnosis,  pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, treatment, and future directions.

While a number of self-report questionnaires have been developed to assess this symptom, none have been comprehensive, and a recent federal government report has recommended the development of a new PEM measure. The current study involved a community-based participatory research process in an effort to develop a comprehensive PEM instrument, with critical patient input shaping the item selection and overall design of the tool. A survey was ultimately developed and was subsequently completed by 1534 members of the patient community. The findings of this survey suggest that there are key domains of this symptom, including triggers, symptom onset, and duration, which have often not been comprehensively assessed in a previous PEM instrument. This study indicates that there are unique benefits that can be derived from patients collaborating with researchers in the measurement of key symptoms defining ME and CFS.  Keywords:   myalgic   encephalomyelitis;   chronic   fatigue   syndrome;   post-exertional   malaise; assessment; patient-driven questionnaire; participatory research  1. Introduction  Among patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), post-exertional malaise (PEM) has long been considered a hallmark symptom [ 1 ]. However, in a field which includes more than twenty case definitions for ME and CFS, there has not been agreement regarding defining PEM [ 2   ]. For example, discrepancies occur with two of the most frequently used ME and CFS case definitions, the Fukuda [ 3   ] and Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC; [ 4   ]). The Fukuda et al. criteria do not define the term beyond requiring that it last for more than 24 h nor does it make PEM a requirement for diagnosis. In contrast, the CCC case definition requires the presence of PEM for diagnosis and goes further to describe the symptomatic experience as similar to flu-like distress, with a potential delayed onset [4]. Several activity and self-report measurements that assess the extent of activity and how such activity might result in exacerbation of symptoms have been proposed to measure PEM. These include actigraphy, exercise challenges, time logs, and self-reports [   5 ]. For example, following an exercise task, Mateo et al. [   6 ] reported a broad spectrum of PEM-related symptoms including fatigue, muscle/joint pain, cognitive dysfunction, decrease in function, headaches, sleep disturbances, pain, weakness, cardiopulmonary symptoms, lightheadedness, and flu-like symptoms. Others have found  Diagnostics   2019 ,   9 , 26; doi:10.3390/diagnostics9010026   www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\n\nDiagnostics   2019 ,   9 , 26   2 of 13  using self-report measures that PEM comprises two distinct constructs: muscle-specific fatigue and generalized fatigue [7]. Factors which elicit PEM include physical and cognitive exertion. For some patients, even basic activities of daily living such as toileting, bathing, dressing, communicating, and reading can trigger PEM. However, many patients feel that potential triggers should extend beyond these types of stressors and include infections [ 8 ], exposure to chemicals or certain foods [   9   ], or exposure to certain metals [   10   ]. Additionally, many efforts to assess PEM have not included a characteristic delay in the onset of PEM. Chu et al. [ 11 ] maintain that this delay is rarely found in other fatiguing illnesses. Another issue that has often not been included in the assessment of PEM is that many patients with ME and CFS take considerably longer to recover from a trigger [   12   ], reporting a substantial increase in symptoms immediately after an exercise test, the next day, and even a week later [13]. In an effort to address these PEM-related discrepancies, the National Institutes of Health/Center for Disease Control and Prevention (NIH/CDC) Common Data Element (CDE) committee’s PEM working group attempted to define PEM [   14   ] as “an abnormal response to minimal amounts of physical or cognitive exertion that is characterized by: (1) Exacerbation of some or all of an individual study participant’s ME/CFS symptoms. (2) Loss of stamina and/or functional capacity. (3) An onset that can be immediate or delayed after the exertional stimulus by hours, days, or even longer. (4) A prolonged, unpredictable recovery period that may last days, weeks, or even months. (5) Severity and duration of symptoms that is often out-of-proportion to the type, intensity, frequency, and/or duration of the exertion.” Yet, there was no set of items with anchor points associated with these 5 descriptors of PEM offered by the NIH/CDC CDE PEM working group. While the general guidance of the committee was helpful, these types of general descriptions need to be operationalized if investigators are to reliably use them to assess PEM. The NIH/CDC CDE’s PEM working group also recommended the use of 5 items from the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ, [   12 ]) to measure PEM (e.g., physically drained or sick after mild activity). However, the DSQ was not developed as a comprehensive measure of PEM but rather as a measure of ME and CFS symptomatology as a whole. Following the release of the NIH/CDC CDE’s PEM recommendations, patients were extremely concerned with the recommendations that had been made [15]. This latest NIH/CDC CDE’s recommendations regarding the measurement of PEM needs to be understood in the context of a long history where patients have felt left out of key policy decisions imposed on them, including how to name, define, and treat ME and CFS. As one example, when the Institute of Medicine (IOM; [ 16   ]) recommended a new name and case definition, this created considerable controversy, as many feel that both were decisions imposed on the patient community, without first seeking their input and approval. The recent recommendations made by this NIH/CDC CDE’s PEM working group, and the vociferous reactions to it by the patient community, provided an opportunity to engage in community-based participatory research, which equitably involves all partners in the research process [ 17 ]. Given the importance of PEM, and the patient community’s resentment regarding once again not being active participants in the development of this latest PEM recommendation, the current authors decided to try to develop a comprehensive measure with active collaboration of the patient community. We hypothesized that a valid PEM instrument could be created with the help of the patient community.  2. Materials and Methods  2.1. Methods and Participants  The study began with dialogue between Leonard Jason and a number of leading patient activists who were unhappy with the NIH/CDC CDE’s PEM recommendations. A patient poll had indicated that the patient community preferred the NIH/CDC general description of PEM rather than the 5 DSQ items [ 15 ], but those general PEM descriptors had not been operationalized in any systematic way. Jason and several patient activists reworked those descriptors into a usable questionnaire, and this was\n\nDiagnostics   2019 ,   9 , 26   3 of 13  posted on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn social media pages and were widely shared with patient groups internationally. Hundreds of emails were received during the next three months, and Jason and Holtzman posted nine revisions of the survey for patients to provide comments. The comments and items received helped shape each new revision of the questionnaire. For example, when one participant commented “I also experience different types of PEM. I have the immediate PEM, where I do too much . . .   But if I stop [exerting myself], these [PEM symptoms] go away fairly quickly   . . .   But if I am not able to stop during this immediate PEM stage and have to push on while experiencing these symptoms, then I get the “Post-PEM” usually two or more days later,” we used this input to introduce survey items that asked about both the immediate and delayed onset of PEM and its relationship to potential triggers. After several months, when we were receiving few additional patient comments regarding our survey that we had been posting, we decided to collect data using this survey with the next phase of this project. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained for collecting data based on the survey that had been developed using input from the patient community. Participants provided informed consent. Participants were required to be over the age of 18 years old, able to read and write in English, and have a current self-reported diagnosis of ME and/or CFS. Participants completed the questionnaire online using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure online survey tool [ 18   ]. Respondents were instructed to save their answers and return to complete the survey at a later time if they were not able to finish the survey in one sitting due to their illness.  2.2. Materials  The first part of the survey assessed demographic characteristics, as well as information about illness/diagnosis status (see Table 1). Following this background assessment, the respondents were asked about the onset of their PEM symptoms (see Table 2), and then asked questions relatin",

Specifically, these treatment trials generally target: (a) the correction of suppressed endocrine axes, notably through a “reactivation” of the pituitary gland’s   pulsatile   secretion of tropic hormones, or (b) the interruption of the “vicious circle” between inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), and low thyroid hormone   function.   There are significant parallels in the treatment trials for   prolonged   critical illness and ME/CFS; this is consistent with the hypothesis of an overlap in the mechanisms that prevent recovery in both conditions. Early successes in the simultaneous reactivation of   pulsatile   pituitary secretions in ICU patients—and the resulting positive metabolic effects—could indicate an avenue for treating ME/CFS. The therapeutic effects of thyroid hormones—including in mitigating O&NS and inflammation and in stimulating the adreno-cortical axis—also merit further studies. Collaborative research projects should further investigate the lessons from treatment trials for   prolonged   critical illness for solving ME/CFS.  Keywords: ME/CFS, treatment, suppressed endocrine axis, prolonged critical illness, oxidative and nitrosative stress, chronic critical care illness, non-thyroidal illness syndrome, post viral fatigue syndrome  INTRODUCTION  Critical illness refers to the physiological response to virtually any   severe   injury or infection, such as sepsis, liver disease, HIV infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection, head injury, pancreatitis, burns, cardiac surgery, etc. generally resulting in intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization ( 1 ).  Prolonged   or chronic critical illness—a term applied to patients that survive   severe   injury or infection but fail to start recovering after a few days—is characterized by the suppression of multiple endocrine axes, irrespective of the nature of the original infection or trauma ( 2 – 7 ). This endocrine suppression is, however, not readily observable in single or average measurements of circulating tropic and non-tropic hormone concentrations (which are a function of both hormone release\n\nStanculescu et al.   Learning From Chronic ICU for Treating ME/CFS  and elimination from the blood stream); instead measurements of the   frequency   and   amplitude   of pituitary secretions (i.e., of the   pulsatility ) performed on ICU patients as often as every 10 min over 24 h are required to reveal the endocrine suppression ( 8 ). Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a role in inducing and maintaining the uniform suppression of the endocrine axes during   prolonged   critical illness—predominantly at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary ( 9 – 15 ). Moreover, reciprocal relationships between cytokines, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), and thyroid hormone   function   appear to perpetuate illness   (c.f.   “vicious   circle”)   ( 13 ,   16 ).   These   patterns   are increasingly recognized as maladaptive and inhibiting patients’ recovery, thus requiring treatment independent of the initial infection or trauma ( 5 ,   17 – 19 ). Moreover, it has been suggested that the persistence of the endocrine disturbances could also explain “post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)” ( 20 ); i.e., “the cognitive, psychiatric and /or physical disability after treatment in ICUs,” including ICU-acquired weakness ( 21 ). ME/CFS is a debilitating, multi-system disease of unclear etiology ( 22 ,   23 ). The most common peri-onset events reported by patients are infection-related episodes, stressful incidents, and exposure to environmental toxins ( 24 ). “Impaired function, post-exertional   malaise   (an   exacerbation   of   some   or   all   of an individual’s ME/CFS symptoms after physical or cognitive exertion, or orthostatic stress that leads to a reduction in functional ability), and unrefreshing sleep” are considered to be core symptoms ( 25 ,   26 ). The severity of the symptoms varies:   “very   severely   affected   patients   experience   profound weakness, almost constant pain, severe limitations to physical and mental activity, sensory hypersensitivity (light, touch, sound, smell, and certain foods), and hypersensitivity to medications” ( 27 ). The disease can be completely incapacitating: “at least one-quarter   of   ME/CFS   patients   are   house-   or   bedbound at   some   point   in   their   lives”   ( 25 ).   Patients   with   milder symptoms experience a significant reduction in previous levels of functioning ( 23 ). The disease progresses over time: similar to critical illness, an early hypermetabolic state may culminate in a hypometabolic state with low energy production ( 28 ). The progressive nature of the disease makes establishing a  Abbreviations:   ACTH,   Adrenocorticotropic   hormone;   AVP,   Arginine vasopressin;   CIM,   Critical   illness   myopathy;   CIRCI,   Critical   illness-related corticosteroid   insufficiency;   CRH,   Corticotrophin-releasing   hormone;   GH, Growth   hormone;   GHIH,   Growth   hormone   inhibiting   hormone;   GHRH, Growth   hormone   releasing   hormone;   GHRP-2,   synthetic   Growth   hormone releasing peptide; GnRH, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GSH, Glutathione; HPA,   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal   axis:   “Adreno-cortical   axis”;   HPG, Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis: “gonadotropic axis”; HPS, Hypothalamic- pituitary-somatotropic axis: “Somatotropic axis”; HPT, Hypothalamic-pituitary- thyroid: “Thyrotropic axis”; HSPs, Heat Shock Proteins; ICU, Intensive Care Unit; IDO, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; IGF-1, Insulin like growth hormone-1; IGFBP, Insulin like growth hormone binding proteins; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase—signal transducer and activator of transcription; LDN, Low Dose Naltrexone; LH, Luteinizing hormone; LHRH, Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone; ME/CFS, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; mtDNA, Mitochondrial DNA; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; NADH, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NTIS, Non-thyroidal illness syndrome; O&NS, oxidative and nitrosative stress; PICS, Post-intensive care syndrome; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; rhGH, Recombinant human GH; TRH, Thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, Thyroid stimulating hormone; VIDD, Ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction.  set   of   diagnostic   criteria   or   molecular   markers   particularly difficult.   There   are   currently   no   effective   treatments   for ME/CFS ( 29 – 33 ). In a previous publication ( 34 ) we argued that—without excluding   possible   predisposing   genetic   or   environmental factors—the maladaptive mechanisms that prevent recovery in some ICU patients may also underlie ME/CFS. Specifically, these mechanisms are: (a) suppression of the pituitary gland’s   pulsatile  secretion of tropic hormones, and (b) a “vicious circle” between inflammation, O&NS, and low thyroid hormone   function.   Here we provide an overview of past treatment trials for   prolonged  ICU   patients   which   specifically   address   these   mechanisms. We relate similar experimental trials to improve outcomes in ME/CFS in order to highlight the similarities in the treatment approaches for both conditions. As part of this overview we also draw on findings from fibromyalgia because ME/CFS and fibromyalgia are often jointly considered in the literature ( 35 ,  36 ); fibromyalgia is similarly a syndrome that is medically unexplained, often comorbid with ME/CFS, and “shares the core symptoms of fatigue, sleep problems, and cognitive difficulties” ( 37 ). Finally, we also suggest potential lessons to be learned from treatment trials for   prolonged   critical illness for the quest to solve ME/CFS. The lessons-learned from the field of critical care medicine for ME/CFS may also be particularly relevant for the aftermath of   the   COVID-19   pandemic.   Coronaviruses   are   associated with persistent inflammation ( 38 ) and endocrine dysfunctions ( 39 )—elements   that   are   central   to   both   the   pathologies   of  prolonged   critical illness and ME/CFS. Many COVID-19 patients continue   to   experience   a   variety   of   debilitating   symptoms despite successfully defeating the virus—termed “post COVID- 19 syndro",

Our objective was to determine the utility of the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) to assess the frequency and severity of common symptoms of ME/CFS, to diagnose and monitor symptoms in patients with PASC.  Methods:   This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled 185 people that included 34 patients with PASC that had positive COVID-19 test and persistent symptoms of   > 3 months and 151 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS. PASC patients were followed over 1 year and responded to the DSQ at baseline and 12 months. ME/CFS patients responded to the DSQ at baseline and 1 year later. Changes in symptoms over time were analyzed using a fixed-effects model to compute difference-in-differences estimates between baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments.  Participants:   Patients were defined as having PASC if they had a previous positive   COVID-19   test,   were   experiencing   symptoms   of   fatigue,   post- exertional malaise, or other unwellness for at least 3 months, were not hospitalized for COVID-19, had no documented major medical or psychiatric diseases prior to COVID-19, and had no other active and untreated disease processes that could explain their symptoms. PASC patients were recruited in 2021. ME/CFS patients were recruited in 2017.  Results:   At baseline, patients with PASC had similar symptom severity and frequency as patients with ME/CFS and satisfied ME/CFS diagnostic criteria. ME/CFS patients experienced significantly more severe unrefreshing sleep and flu-like symptoms. Five symptoms improved significantly over the course of 1 year for PASC patients including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, irritable bowel symptoms and feeling unsteady. In contrast, there were no significant symptom improvements for ME/CFS patients.  Conclusion and relevance:   There were considerable similarities between patients with PASC and ME/CFS at baseline. However, symptoms improved  Frontiers in Medicine   01   frontiersin.org\n\nOliveira et al.   10.3389/fmed.2022.1065620  for PASC patients over the course of a year but not for ME/CFS patients. PASC patients with significant symptom improvement no longer met ME/CFS clinical diagnostic criteria. These findings indicate that the DSQ can be used to reliably assess and monitor PASC symptoms.  KEYWORDS  post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, unrefreshing sleep, brain fog, Long COVID, myalgic encephalomyelitis, fatigue, post-exertional malaise  Introduction  The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide now exceeds 624 million (1). As with previous infectious outbreaks,   COVID-19   has   caused   significant,   unresolved adverse health outcomes and disability. Current estimates of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly referred to as Long COVID, are 49% at 4 months from acute COVID-19 infection (2). Unexplained chronic symptoms after acute infections have been well-described for a number of other infectious diseases (3). These post-infectious syndromes are stereotypical and commonly   characterized   by   fatigue   that   impairs   physical function,   post-exertional   malaise,   unrefreshing   sleep, orthostatic intolerance, and cognitive impairment (4). Among the more well-established post-infectious syndromes is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic   fatigue   syndrome   (ME/CFS),   a condition with many symptom similarities as PASC (5, 6). Critical to improving long-term outcomes of PASC is the identification of clinical tools that can facilitate early diagnosis, monitor trends of disability, and track progress toward recovery. Because of the symptom overlap between PASC and ME/CFS, a tool of particular interest is the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ). The DSQ is a validated self-report questionnaire of 54 symptoms with excellent discriminant validity to diagnose ME/CFS, and high test-retest reliability to track symptoms over time (7). To assess the potential utility of the DSQ as a tool to diagnose and track recovery of patients with PASC the aims of this study were to (1) measure the prevalence and trends of DSQ-SF symptoms in a cohort of patients with PASC, and (2) assess the commonalities and differences in symptomatology and recovery between patients with PASC and ME/CFS.  Materials and methods  Study design and participants  For   this   prospective,   observational   cohort   study,   we recruited   patients   between   the   ages   of   18–65   who   met PASC criteria at study entry and were eligible to participate. Patients were defined as having PASC if they had documentation of previous COVID-19 (i.e., positive SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or antigen or IgG prior to receiving COVID-19 vaccination) and were experiencing symptoms of fatigue, post-exertional malaise, or other unwellness for at least 3 months that either the subject or their clinician judged to be due to COVID-19. Patients were eligible to participate if they were in good general health with no documented major medical or psychiatric diseases prior to COVID-19. Patients were excluded from study participation if they were hospitalized for   > 72 h for COVID-19, had documented organ damage as a result of COVID-19 infection, or had other active and untreated disease processes that could explain their symptoms (see   Supplementary Table 1   for full exclusion criteria). ME/CFS patients were recruited in 2017 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) and included patients between the ages of 18–65, who met the 2015 ME/CFS clinical diagnostic criteria ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and were eligible to participate. The protocol was approved by The Jackson Laboratory Institutional Review Board study number 17-JGM-13 and the study was carried out according to United States federal regulations for the protection of human subjects as codified in 45 CFR 46. This study was carried out with adequate understanding and written consent of the participants.  Measures  The DSQ was administered using REDCap at the start of the study and again after a 1-year follow-up (8). Using the DSQ, participants rated each symptom over the previous 6 months on a 5-point Likert-type scale in terms of frequency (e.g., 0 = None of the time, 1 = A little of the time, 2 = About half the time, 3 = Most of the time, and 4 = All of the time), and severity (e.g., 0 = Absent, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe, and 4 = Very severe).  Statistical analysis  Descriptive analyses were first performed to characterize the   sociodemographic   characteristics   of   each   cohort. Race/ethnicity   was   dichotomized   to   indicate   whether   a  Frontiers in Medicine   02   frontiersin.org\n\nOliveira et al.   10.3389/fmed.2022.1065620  patient self-identified as non-Hispanic White vs. other racial and ethnic groups. The highest grade of education attained was   similarly   dichotomized   to   indicate   if   a   participant had   completed   at   least   some   post-secondary   education. Fisher’s   exact   or   Wilcoxon   tests   were   used   to   assess between-group   differences   in   categorical   and   continuous variables, respectively. For the primary analysis, the percent prevalence of each symptom reported on the DSQ was estimated as the percent of patients who have values   ≥ 2 on both the frequency and severity questions for the given symptom. To compare the difference in the prevalence of symptoms between patients with ME/CFS vs. PASC, Poisson regression was used to generate risk ratios (RR) with robust variances. A composite score was also computed for each symptom reported on the DSQ-Short Form (DSQ-SF), a subset of 14 of 54 questions from the DSQ. The composite score considered the responses from the baseline and follow-up surveys separately and was estimated by taking the mean of the frequency and severity scores for ",

Across the globe, a subset of patients who sustain an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are developing a wide range of persistent symptoms that do not resolve over the course of many months. These patients are being given the diagnosis Long COVID or Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). It is likely that individual patients with a PASC diagnosis have different underlying biological factors driving their symptoms, none of which are mutually exclusive. This paper details mechanisms by which RNA viruses beyond just SARS-CoV-2 have be connected to long-term health consequences. It also reviews literature on acute COVID-19 and other virus-initiated chronic syndromes such as post- Ebola syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) to discuss different scenarios for PASC symptom development. Potential contributors to PASC symptoms include consequences from acute SARS-CoV-2 injury to one or multiple organs, persistent reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in certain tissues, re-activation of neurotrophic pathogens such as herpesviruses under conditions of COVID-19 immune dysregulation, SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation issues, dysfunctional brainstem/vagus nerve signaling, ongoing activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host proteins. The individualized nature of PASC symptoms suggests that different therapeutic approaches may be required to best manage care for specific patients with the diagnosis.  Keywords: COVID-19, long COVID, SARS-CoV-2, microbiome, vagus, brainstem, infection, virus  INTRODUCTION  The novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Hiscott et al., 2020). Classic cases of acute COVID-19 are characterized by respiratory symptoms, fever, and gastrointestinal problems (Larsen et al., 2020). However, patients can present with a wide range of other symptoms, including neurological issues suggesting central nervous system (CNS) involvement  Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org   1   June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 698169\n\nProal and VanElzakker   Overview of PASC Biology  (Harapan and Yoo, 2021). Acute COVID-19 cases range in length and severity. Many patients are asymptomatic, while others require   hospitalization   and   ventilation   (Cunningham   et   al., 2021). Overall, an average case of COVID-19 lasts between 1 and 4 weeks. However, across the globe, a subset of patients who sustain an acute SARS CoV-2 infection are developing a wide range of persistent symptoms that do not resolve over the course of many months (Carfì et al., 2020; Davis et al., 2020; Huang C. et al., 2021) ( Figure 1 ). One study of COVID-19 patients who were followed for up to 9 months after illness found that approximately 30% reported persistent symptoms (Logue et al., 2021). These patients are being given the diagnosis Long COVID, post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 is being diagnosed in patients who developed severe acute COVID-19, but also in patients who experienced only mild or asymptomatic cases. For example, Tabacof et al. (2020) reported a range of long-term symptoms in a cohort of previously confirmed or presumed COVID-19 patients whose acute symptoms were largely managed without the need for hospitalization. Another team documented persistent COVID-19 symptoms in 1,407 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2   infection   (Huang   Y.   et   al.,   2021).   Symptoms included fatigue and muscle weakness, insomnia, palpitations, chronic rhinitis, dysgeusia, chills, sore throat, and headache. 27% of subjects reported persistent symptoms after 60 days, with patients aged 50   ±   20 years comprising 72% of cases. Women were more likely to report persistent symptoms, and   ∼ 32% of subjects reporting symptoms at 61 +   days after infection were asymptomatic at the time of initial SARS-CoV-2 testing. While the development of long-term symptoms following SARS-CoV-2   infection   is   sometimes   framed   as   novel   or mysterious, it is actually an expected phenomenon. Most well- studied viral or bacterial pathogens have been connected to the development of chronic symptoms in a subset of infected patients (Bannister, 1988; Rebman and Aucott, 2020; Komaroff and Bateman, 2021). For example, Ebola virus is associated with a chronic syndrome that can develop after acute infection (Wilson et al., 2018), with reservoirs of Ebola sometimes identified in “anatomical sanctuaries” in patient tissue months or years after the virus has cleared from the blood (Lo et al., 2017; Keita et al., 2019). Some PASC patients meet the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic   fatigue   syndrome   (ME/CFS)   –   a neuroinflammation-linked condition characterized by a range of   debilitating   chronic   symptoms   including   severe   fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and post-exertional malaise (worsening of symptoms following exertion) (Carruthers et al., 2011; Clayton, 2015; Kedor et al., 2021; Komaroff and Bateman, 2021). Overlap between the PASC and ME/CFS diagnoses is not surprising, since most cases of ME/CFS begin with a viral infection, or involve multiple exposures to viral and bacterial pathogens over time (Rasa et al., 2018). Pathogens   most   commonly   implicated   in   ME/CFS development   include   neurotrophic   herpesviruses   and enteroviruses. Several studies have found that active HHV-6 infection   is   more   common   in   ME/CFS   than   controls (Komaroff, 2006).   Enteroviruses,   several   species   of   which can be acquired via respiratory infection, have been identified in brain, skeletal muscle, and stomach biopsy specimens of certain patients with ME/CFS (Gow et al., 1991; McGarry et al., 1994; Richardson, 2001; Chia and Chia, 2008). Other respiratory pathogens have also been linked to the development of ME/CFS- like symptoms (Magnus et al., 2015). For example, one team studied 233 SARS survivors approximately 4 years after initial infection, and found that 27.1% met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (Lam et al., 2009). It is likely that the different pathogens implicated in ME/CFS development are capable of dysregulating host gene expression, immunity, and metabolism via similar mechanisms, leading to similar sets of chronic symptoms in ME/CFS-diagnosed patients (VanElzakker, 2013; Proal and Marshall, 2018). However, a range of additional biological factors, including changes in host microbiome composition and activity, can also contribute to ME/CFS development (Giloteaux et al., 2016; Newberry et al., 2018). The same trend may be true of PASC cases, in which SARS- CoV-2 infection may instigate or exacerbate different biological abnormalities in patients with the diagnosis. This   paper   reviews   relevant   ME/CFS,   neuroscience, microbiology,   and   single-stranded   RNA   virus   literatures   to explore a range of biological factors that may contribute to the development of chronic symptoms after acute COVID-19, none of which are mutually exclusive. These include consequences from acute injury caused by SARS-CoV-2, persistent reservoirs of   SARS-CoV-2   in   certain   tissues,   re-activation   of   other neurotrophic   pathogens   under   conditions   of   COVID-19 immune   dysregulation,   SARS-CoV-2   interactions   with   host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation issues, disrupted   brainstem/vagus   nerve   signaling,   ongoing   activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host peptides.  ACUTE COVID-19  In order to best understand persistent symptoms arising from SARS-CoV-2   infection   we   must   first   review   major   trends associated with SARS CoV-2 activity in patients with acute COVID-19.   SARS-CoV-2   is   a   positive-sense   single-stranded RNA   virus   (V’kovski   et   al.,   2021).   It   is   one   of   seven coronaviruses capable of infecting humans (Corman et al., 2018). Compared with other coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-NL63, HCoV- 229E, and HCoV-OC43) that are pathogenic to humans but generally drive only mild clinical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 more closely resembles MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (sometimes called SARS-CoV-1) in that it is capable of causing severe disease (Zhu et al., 2020). Many   COVID-19   patients   are   asymptomatic   ( ∼ 40–45%) (Oran and Topol, 2020) or exhibit mild to moderate symptoms (Zheng P. et al., 2020). However, approximately 15% progress to severe pneumonia, w",

Post–exertional malaise is a worsening of these symptoms after a physical or mental exertion and is considered a central feature of the illness. Scant observations in the available literature provide qualitative assessments of post–exertional malaise in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. To enhance our understanding, a series of outpatient focus groups were convened.  Methods:   Nine focus groups totaling 43 patients who reported being diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome were held between November 2016 and August 2019. Focus groups queried post–exertional malaise in daily life and participants’ retrospective memory of post–exertional malaise that followed an exercise provocation with a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Data analysis followed the grounded theory method to systematically code and categorize the data to find meaningful patterns. A qualitative software package was used to move text into categories during data coding.  Results:   A   wide   range   of   symptoms   were   attributed   to   exertion   both   in   daily lives   and   following   cardiopulmonary   exercise   testing.   While   three   core   symptoms emerged (exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, and neuromuscular complaints), participants’ descriptions were notable for their unique individual variations. Of 18 participants who responded to questions centered around symptoms following a cardiopulmonary exercise test, 17 reported that symptoms started within 24 h and peaked in severity within 72 h following the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Patients described post–exertional malaise as interfering with their ability to lead a “normal” life.  Conclusion:   The   experience   of   post–exertional   malaise   in   myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome varies greatly between individuals and leads to a diminished quality of life. myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome\n\nStussman et al.   Characterization of Post-exertional Malaise  patients describe post–exertional malaise as all-encompassing with symptoms affecting every   part   of   the   body,   difficult   to   predict   or   manage,   and   requiring   complete bedrest to fully or partially recover. Given the extensive variability in patients, further research identifying subtypes of post–exertional malaise could lead to better targeted therapeutic options.  Keywords: myalgic encephalitis, chronic fatgue syndrome, post-exertional malaise, exhaustion, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, exercise intolerance  INTRODUCTION  Persistent and disabling fatigue, exercise intolerance, cognitive difficulties, and musculoskeletal/joint pain are characteristic of a disorder that has been referred to as the Royal Free Disease, benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and systemic exertion intolerance disease at various times in history ( 1 ). The term  myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome   is currently the most common term used in diagnostic criteria, by advocates, and by the US Federal Government to refer to the illness ( 2 ). Post–exertional malaise (PEM) is a worsening of these symptoms after minimal physical or mental exertion ( 3 ). PEM is   considered   a   central   feature   of   ME/CFS   ( 4 ).   The   cause of ME/CFS remains unknown, and there are no approved diagnostic tests or treatments ( 5 ). Historically, measurement of PEM has had considerable controversy, and patient groups have felt left out of the process by which policy makers develop definitions of ME/CFS ( 6 ,   7 ). Qualitative research affords patients an opportunity to discuss their experiences with researchers at length and inform patient-focused clinical decision making ( 8 ). Previous qualitative assessments of ME/CFS have shown a significant and debilitating effect on the lives of patients. ME/CFS   patients   have   described   the   fatigue   experience   as all-encompassing and debilitating, fluctuating, unpredictable, often triggered by minor activities, and causing a significant impediment to daily functioning ( 7 ). A previous study using qualitative telephone interviews found the lessening ability to independently perform daily tasks had a significant impact on psychological well-being of ME/CFS patients ( 9 ). The one study of which we are aware that employed focus groups to   explore   PEM   in   individuals   with   ME/CFS   ( 10 )   queried patients about different dimensions of fatigue and found distinct physical and cognitive dimensions, including five key themes: exhausted, drained of energy, heavy feeling, cognitive fog, and muscle weakness. Previous quantitative studies looking at PEM in ME/CFS patients have shown a wide range of physical and cognitive symptoms affecting every part of the body ( 6 ,   11 – 13 ). These studies have detailed common PEM symptoms (e.g., physical fatigue, cognitive exhaustion, muscle pain, unrefreshed sleep, and headaches) and timeframes for symptom onset and duration. A recent study ( 11 ) used survey data to summarize symptoms, triggers, and time patterns for onset and duration of PEM and  Abbreviations:   ME/CFS, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome; PEM, post–exertional malaise; CPET, cardiopulmonary exercise test.  found most patients experienced several cognitive and physical symptoms and that triggers of PEM can be physical, cognitive, and emotional. That study also found that onset relative to exertion ranged from immediate to more than 24 h, and duration ranged from   < 1 h to years. Although the scientific literature provides few qualitative assessments of PEM in ME/CFS patients, qualitative descriptions of chronic fatigue have been made in other health disorders. A metasynthesis of fatigue across several long-term conditions such as cancer and stroke, not including ME/CFS, produced some commonalities in the fatigue experience ( 14 ). For instance, participants described fatigue as unpredictable in occurrence, intensity, and duration and feeling a loss of control of the body. Patients with whiplash-associated disorders suffer from fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive deficits similar to ME/CFS patients ( 15 ). Chronic fatigue can be unpredictable and triggered by anxiety and emotional trauma ( 16 ). Using the DePaul PEM Questionnaire, one study found the fatigue experience in a subset of cancer patients was similar to PEM in ME/CFS patients ( 17 ). However, unlike ME/CFS patients, many patients with fatiguing conditions such as multiple sclerosis and post-polio syndrome are able to exercise without experiencing PEM ( 13 ). Because PEM in ME/CFS patients is still underexplored, especially through purely qualitative methods, the aim of the current   study   was   to   expand   the   knowledge   base   on   the symptoms; manner of onset; timeframes for onset, peak, and duration of PEM; and impact on day-to-day lives of patients. We aimed to understand how ME/CFS is impacted by exertion in   day-to-day   life   and   how   this   compares   to   the   impact after cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Additionally, we wanted to delve deeper into the experience of PEM following CPET, a gap in the current research. Based on the literature we expected to find a feeling of loss of control and unpredictability to PEM. We also expected to find physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects. We present results from nine focus groups conducted to better understand PEM experiences from the perspective of ME/CFS patients. Focus groups were centered on ME/CFS patients’ usual daily symptoms and how these changed or worsened following exertion. Additionally, for five of the nine focus groups, we recruited ME/CFS patients who had undergone a CPET evaluation and prompted them to report their memory of the symptoms following the CPET evaluation. The primary purpose of the focus groups was to provide a richer and more nuanced understanding of how ME/CFS patients experience their illness. Secondarily, results from the ",

Expanding research on the human microbiome now allows ME/CFS-associated pathogens to be studied as interacting members of human microbiome communities. Humans harbor these vast ecosystems of bacteria, viruses and fungi in nearly all tissue and blood. Most well-studied inflammatory conditions are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of the human microbiome. While gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS, microbes and viruses outside the gut can also contribute to the illness. Pathobionts, and their associated proteins/metabolites, often control human metabolism and gene expression in a manner that pushes the body toward a state of illness. Intracellular pathogens, including many associated with ME/CFS, drive microbiome dysbiosis   by   directly   interfering   with   human   transcription,   translation,   and   DNA repair processes. Molecular mimicry between host and pathogen proteins/metabolites further complicates this interference. Other human pathogens disable mitochondria or dysregulate host nervous system signaling. Antibodies and/or clonal T cells identified in patients with ME/CFS are likely activated in response to these persistent microbiome pathogens. Different human pathogens have evolved similar survival mechanisms to disable the host immune response and host metabolic pathways. The metabolic dysfunction driven by these organisms can result in similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms. ME/CFS may be driven by this pathogen-induced dysfunction, with the nature of dysbiosis and symptom presentation varying based on a patient’s unique infectious and environmental history. Under such conditions, patients would benefit from treatments that support the human immune system in an effort to reverse the infectious disease process.

This   thinking greatly applies to the illness ME/CFS. ME/CFS is characterized by neuroinflammation, severe fatigue, excessive post-exertional exhaustion, disturbed sleep, flu-like episodes, cognitive problems, sensory   hypersensitivity,   muscle   and   joint   pain,   headache, bowel symptoms, and severe impairment of daily functioning ( 2 ). Severely ill individuals are often wheelchair dependent, bedridden, and unable to perform basic tasks of work or daily living. The history of ME/CFS strongly suggests that infectious agents play a central role in driving the disease process. These include early associations with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)/Human Herpes   Virus   6   (HHV6),   the   relapsing-remitting   nature   of ME/CFS symptoms and antibodies/“autoantibodies” detected in patients with the disease ( 3 ,   4 ). A number of ME/CFS outbreaks have also been reported, in which numerous people in the same geographical location developed the illness simultaneously ( 2 ). Indeed, many ME/CFS patients present with symptoms after suffering from a severe bacterial or viral infection. These infections often correlate with travel to a foreign country or exposure to pollutants or molds, suggesting that such pathogens take advantage of factors that compromise the host immune system. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of persistent infection. Reports   of   cytokine   activation   in   ME/CFS   clarify   that   the disease   is   associated   with   an   inflammatory   response   ( 5 ). Montoya   et   al.   ( 6 )   found   ME/CFS   cytokine   activation increased   with   disease   severity,   suggesting   patients   may struggle with a growing infectious burden over time. Other ME/CFS   research   teams   have   identified   various   forms   of mitochondrial   dysfunction   in   patients   with   the   illness   ( 7 ). There   are   now   dozens   of   well-characterized   mechanisms by   which   bacteria   and   viruses   dysregulate   mitochondrial metabolism ( 8 ,   9 ). Many research teams have searched for well-characterized single   pathogens   in   patients   with   ME/CFS.   These   analyses often reveal elevated titers of IGG and IGM antibodies toward pathogens   such   as   Epstein   Barr   Virus,   Cytomegalovirus, Parvovirus 19 and   M. pneumonia   ( 2 ,   3 ,   10 ). Several teams have also attempted to identify a single novel pathogen that might   drive   the   entire   ME/CFS   disease   process.   However, the discovery of the human microbiome now allows single microbes and viruses to be studied as members of complex communities.   Humans   harbor   these   vast   ecosystems   of bacteria,   viruses   and   fungi   in   nearly   all   tissue   and   blood ( 11 – 14 ). Organisms in the microbiome continually interact with each other, and with the human genome, to regulate host   metabolism   and   gene   expression   in   both   health   and disease ( 15 ,   16 ). A growing number of inflammatory disease states, including neurological conditions and cancers, are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of these human microbiome communities ( 17 – 20 ). Gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS ( 21 ). This dysbiosis is characterized by changes in microbe species composition and/or diversity. Pathogens, or groups of pathogens, can promote dysbiosis by altering their gene expression in ways that promote virulence, immunosuppression and dysregulation of host genetic and metabolic pathways ( 22 ). When seemingly disparate biomedical findings on ME/CFS are interpreted through the lens of these microbiome-based paradigms and platforms, a cohesive picture of the ME/CFS disease process emerges. ME/CFS may be driven by pathogen- induced   dysfunction,   with   resulting   microbiome   dysbiosis varying based on a patient’s unique infectious and environmental history. Under such conditions, patients would benefit from treatments that, like those now being developed for cancer, support the human immune system in an effort to reverse the inflammatory disease process.  THE HUMAN MICROBIOME PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THE BODY  In the USA, ME/CFS cases were first formally reported to the CDC in the 1980s ( 2 ). At the time, human microbes were typically only detected with culture-based laboratory methods. Then, around the year 2000, novel genome-based technologies began to revolutionize the field of microbiology ( 23 ,   24 ). These technologies identify microbes based on their DNA or RNA signatures rather than their ability to grow in the laboratory. The results of these genome-based analyses were remarkable: vast communities of microbes were identified in the human body that had been missed by the older culture-based techniques. These extensive ecosystems of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea are collectively known as the human microbiome ( 25 – 27 ). Today, so many novel microbes have been identified in  Homo sapiens   that our human cells are equivalent to or even outnumbered by those of our microbial inhabitants ( 28 ). The tens of millions of unique genes harbored by this microbiome dwarf the   ∼ 20,500 genes in the human genome ( 12 ,   29 ). For example, just one 2017 analysis of the human gut, skin, mouth, and vaginal microbiomes uncovered millions of previously unknown microbial genes ( 11 ). This has forced science to redefine the human condition. Humans are best described as holobionts, in   which   the   microbial   genomes   and   the   human   genome continually   interact   to   regulate   metabolism   and   immunity ( 15 ,   16 ). Early human microbiome studies characterized microbial ecosystems in the gut and on mucosal surfaces. However, the microbiome has now been shown to extend to nearly every human body site. These include the lungs, the bladder, the placenta, the testes, and the uterus [( 19 ,   30 – 33 )]. Jakobsen et al. ( 35 ) found that previously sterile implants removed from joints, bones, pacemakers, and skulls of symptom-free patients were colonized by a range of bacterial and fungal organisms. Another study demonstrated the presence of novel tissue specific bacterial DNA profiles in a variety of mouse organs including the brain, heart, liver, muscle and adipose tissue ( 36 ).

In this perspective paper we want to re fl ect on how PEM is understood, assessed, and evaluated in scienti fi c literature, and to identify topics to be addressed in future research. Studies show that patients use a wide variety of words and concepts to label their experience of PEM in everyday life, and they report physical or mental exertions as triggers of PEM. They also report that PEM may have an immediate or delayed onset and may last from a few days to several months. When standardized exercise tests are used to trigger PEM experimentally, the exacerbation of symptoms has a more immediate onset but still shows a wide variability in duration. There are indications of altered muscular metabolism   and   autonomic   nervous   responses   if   exercise   is   repeated   on successive days in patients with ME/CFS. The decreased muscular capacity appears to be maintained over several days following such controlled exercise bouts. These responses may correspond to patients ’   experiences of increased exertion. Based on this background we argue that there is a need to look more closely into the processes occurring in the restitution period following exercise, as PEM reaches the peak in this phase.

Over the years several sets of diagnostic criteria have been developed to classify ME/CFS.

In the International Consensus Criteria, however, PEM is considered a hallmark used to differentiate ME/CFS patients from patients with other chronic illnesses and persistent   fatigue   (Carruthers   et   al.,   2011).   These   authors describe   PEM   as   a   perceived   exacerbation   of   some,   or   all symptoms   of   ME/CFS   after   physical   or   cognitive   exertion. Further, PEM is described as a disproportional worsening of symptoms due to physical or cognitive efforts that previously was well tolerated, typically with a delayed onset and lasting for variable   and   often   extended   periods   of   time   (Nacul   et   al., 2021).   In   the   later   years,   PEM   has   been   investigated   by qualitative   interviews   of   patients,   assessed   by   standardized self-reports   alone   or   in   combination   with   experimental triggering actions such as exercise tests or mental challenges (Nacul et al., 2021). However, to our knowledge the relationship between PEM as experienced in every-day life and experimentally induced PEM is scarcely examined. On this background, the purpose of this perspective paper is to examine if there is coherence between PEM as described by patients with their own words, PEM assessed by standardized questionnaires, as   well   as   exercise-induced   PEM   by   experimental   models.   In addition, we will discuss how the exercise tests can be further developed to capture relevant aspects of PEM and the possible underlying biological mechanisms.  PEM as experienced in everyday life  PEM is narrated by patients as well as assessed by structured self- reports. Moreover, PEM has been examined in terms of exacerbation of ME/CFS symptoms, what triggers the exacerbations in daily life, as well as the time of onset and duration of symptoms before recovery. The literature used is summarized in Table 1. PEM is found to relate to exacerbations of fatigue, cognitive dif fi culties (cannot think clearly, memory   problems),   sleep   problems,   neuromuscular   complaints (pain/aches   and   weakness),   bodily   heaviness,   fl ulike   symptoms and impacts on daily functioning (Baraniuk et al., 2013; Chu et al., 2018; Jason et al., 2018; Davenport et al., 2023a).

Patients attending a private medical practice specializing in CFS were diagnosed using the Centers for Disease Control criteria. In consultation with each patient, an integer on the Bell Ability Scale was assigned, and a blood sample was taken for the “ATP profile” test, designed for CFS and other fatigue conditions. Each test produced 5 numerical factors which describe the availability of ATP in neutrophils, the fraction complexed with magnesium, the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and the transfer efficiencies of ADP into the mitochondria and ATP into the cytosol where the energy is used. With the consent of each of 71 patients and 53 normal, healthy controls the 5 factors have been collated and compared with the Bell Ability Scale. The individual numerical factors show that patients have different combinations of biochemical lesions. When the factors are combined, a remarkable correlation is observed between the degree of mitochondrial dysfunction and the severity of illness ( P <0.001). Only 1 of the 71 patients overlaps the normal region. The “ATP profile” test is a powerful diagnostic tool and can differentiate patients who have fatigue and other symptoms as a result of energy wastage by stress and psychological factors from those who have insufficient energy due to cellular respiration dysfunction. The individual factors indicate which remedial actions, in the form of dietary supplements, drugs and detoxification, are most likely to be of benefit, and what further tests should be carried out.  Key   Words:   Chronic   fatigue   syndrome,   myalgic   encephalomyelitis,   mitochondria,   neutrophils,   oxidative phosphorylation.  Introduction  Chronic   Fatigue   Syndrome   (CFS)   is   a multisystem illness that robs its victims of their health   and   their   dignity.   Two   of   the   most characteristic and debilitating signs of CFS are very poor stamina and delayed post-exertional fatigue.   Sometimes   the   fatigue   is   mainly mental,   and   sometimes   mainly   physical. Fatigue is the same as lack of energy and energy   comes   from   the   basic   metabolic process of the oxidation of food.  A   widely-held   hypothesis   (A)   is   that   the metabolism of people with CFS is normal, but the fatigue and other symptoms are due to psychological factors. It is acknowledged that physical fatigue is lack of energy, but mental fatigue   is   considered   to   be   a   subjective sensation characterized by lack of motivation and of alertness [1], even though the brain is a major   consumer   of   resting   cellular   energy. Patients   may   demonstrate   negative   illness beliefs   that   increase   the   severity   of   the symptoms [2, 3]. However, if the metabolism is functioning properly, the fatigue and related symptoms   must   be   due   to   energy   being wasted by the mental and physical processes of   stress,   anxiety,   tension   and   depression. Patients should be able to be helped, possibly cured   by   psychological   intervention,   e.g. cognitive   behavioural   therapy.   In   order   to explain the post-exertional malaise an ancillary hypothesis   (A')   is   needed,   namely deconditioning   due   to   disuse   of   muscles. However, hypothesis A' is not supported by\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome and mitochondrial dysfunction  Int J Clin Exp Med (2009) 2, 1-16 2  experiment   in   many   cases   as   we   will   see below. An alternative hypothesis (B) is that there is a metabolic dysfunction with the result that not enough energy is being produced. The main source of energy comes from the complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water. The digestive system produces glucose, glycerol and fatty acids, and amino acids. If there is a problem with the digestive system, e.g.   gut   fermentation,   hypochlorhydria   or pancreatic insufficiency, energy production will be impaired and fatigue may result [4]. These conditions   can   and   should   be   tested   for. Allergies   and   thyroid   malfunction   can   also produce fatigue. When   the   digestive   system   is   functioning properly glucose and lipids are fed into the blood   stream   where,   together   with   oxygen bound   to   hemoglobin   in   erythrocytes   (red blood cells), they are transported to every cell in the body. In the cytosol of each cell glucose is   broken   down   in   a   series   of   chemical reactions called glycolysis into two molecules of pyruvate which enter the energy-producing organelles present in most cells of the body, the mitochondria. Some structural details and the   number   of   mitochondria   per   cell   are dictated by the typical energy requirements; cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and liver and brain cells contain the highest numbers. The mitochondria   generate   energy   by   oxidative metabolism   in   the   form of   ATP   (adenosine triphosphate) which when hydrolysed to the diphosphate, ADP, releases energy to produce muscle contractions, nerve impulses and all the energy-consuming processes including the chemical energy needed to synthesise all of the complex molecules of the body [5, 6]. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction will result in fatigue and can produce other symptoms of CFS. The   two   hypotheses   are   not   mutually exclusive.   Some   patients   may   satisfy   both. However   there   are   constraints;   the   basal metabolic rate (about 7000 kJ per day) must be   maintained   and   the   first   law   of thermodynamics must not be violated.  There   is   considerable   evidence   that mitochondrial dysfunction is present in some CFS   patients.   Muscle   biopsies   studied   by electron   microscopy   have   shown   abnormal mitochondrial   degeneration   [7-9].   Biopsies have also found severe deletions of genes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), genes that are associated with bioenergy production [9, 10]. One   consequence   of   mitochondrial dysfunction   is   increased   production   of   free radicals which cause oxidative damage. Such oxidative   damage   and   increased   activity   of antioxidant   enzymes   has   been   detected   in muscle   specimens   [11].   Some   essential compounds   (carnitine   and   N-acylcarnitine) needed   for   some   metabolic   reactions   in mitochondria have been measured in serum and found to be decreased in patients with CFS [12, 13].   Both studies found that the carnitine   levels   correlated   with   functional capacity. Reduced oxidative metabolism [14- 16] and higher concentrations of xenobiotics, lactate and pyruvate [17] have been reported. In   one   group   of   patients   a   decrease   of intracellular pH after moderate exercise was observed and a lower rate of ATP synthesis during   recovery   was   measured   [18].   These findings suggest impaired recycling of ADP to ATP in the mitochondria.  However, there are also some similar studies that do not confirm mitochondrial dysfunction. This situation   is likely due to   the different diagnostic criteria in use. For example, the Oxford criteria [1], a definition proposed by psychiatrists,   require   only   fatigue;   “other symptoms   may   be   present”   but   are   not essential.   The   Centers   for   Disease   Control (CDC)   criteria   are   more   selective   as   they require an additional four symptoms from a list of eight [19]. In England in 2007 the National Institute   for   Clinical   Excellence   (NICE) introduced yet another set of criteria, fatigue plus   one   more   symptom,   for   example “persistent sore throat” [20]. At the other end of the spectrum are criteria based on studies of   patients   with   Myalgic   Encephalomyelitis (ME) [21-23] which have culminated in the Canadian   consensus   criteria   [24];   the Canadian   criteria   are   unlikely   to   include patients   satisfying   only   hypothesis   A.   Even more confusingly, both the Canadian and the new   NICE   criteria   use   the   term   ME/CFS although their criteria are very different. At the present   time   the   CDC   criteria   are internationally widely used as the criteria for research   purposes   despite   their   lack   of precision [25]. This situation may change in the future because the Canadian criteria are gaining wider acceptance and one charitable research funding agency (ME Research UK) now   requires   both   the   CDC   and   Canadian\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome and mitochondrial dysfunction  Int J Clin Exp Med (2009) 2, 1-16 3  criteria to be used in research projects that it funds. We use the term CFS or CFS/ME for the CDC criteria and ME/CFS for the Canadian criteria. Our study is aimed to assess the role of mitochondrial dysfunction with the primary aim of helping patients Hypothesis   B   is   attractive   because mitochondrial   dysfunction   in   various   organs offers possible explanations for many of the other   symptoms   of   CFS   and   ME.   There   is mounting evidence that the symptoms are due to   dysfunctions   on   the   cellular   level. Abnormalities have been seen in immune cells [26],   and   gene   expression   studies   have reveale",

D. Acheson (later to be- come Chief Medical Officer of England) and oth- ers carefully described the symptom pattern of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis as long ago as 1959 [1], and the World Health Organization recog- nized M.E. as a neurological illness in 1969. However these facts are ignored by a substan- tial fraction of the medical community, and a patient can be labeled as having ME/CFS or just M.E. by just being chronically fatigued. The most characteristic and disabling symptom of M.E. is the postexertional malaise following activity or exercise, either physical or mental, often one to three days later. Fortunately, the importance of this key symptom has been recognized in recent years and incorporated into the International Consensus Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomye- litis (ICCME) [2]. In spite of many biomedical studies, there is inadequate understanding of the biochemical processes which lead to this malaise and there is no recognized biomedical test for this illness. In the first Section, we demonstrate that bio- chemical tests such as the ATP Profile do exist that can identify those patients who have a cel- lular biological reason for their symptoms. In the second Section, we use the results of the various tests which make up the ATP Profile to unravel the basic pathophysiology of the mito- chondrial   dysfunction   and   how   cellular   proc- esses are modified in an attempt to compen- Int J Clin Exp Med 2012;5(3):208-220 www.ijcem.com /ISSN:1940-5901/IJCEM1204005  Original Article  Mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathophysiology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Norman E Booth 1 , Sarah Myhill 2 , John McLaren-Howard 3  1   Department of Physics and Mansfield College, University of Oxford, Oxford UK;   2   Sarah Myhill Ltd, Llangunllo, Powys UK;   3   Acumen, Tiverton, Devon UK  Received April 26, 2012; accepted May 21, 2012; Epub June 15, 2012; Published June 30, 2012 Abstract: The objectives of this study are to test the hypothesis that the fatigue and accompanying symptoms of Chronic Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Fatigue Syndrome are in part due to defects in energy provision at the cellular level, and to understand the pathophysiology of the defects so that effective medical intervention can be imple- mented. We performed an audit of 138 patients (ages 18-65) diagnosed with ME/CFS and attending a private prac- tice. The patients and 53 normal, healthy controls had the ATP Profile test carried out on neutrophils from a 3-ml venous blood sample. This test yields 6 numerical factors that describe the availability of ATP and the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Other biomedical measurements, including the concentration of cell-free DNA in plasma, were made. The results of the audit are compared with the controls and a previous cohort of 61 pa- tients. We find that all patients tested have measureable mitochondrial dysfunction which correlates with the severity of the illness. The patients divide into two main groups differentiated by how cellular metabolism attempts to com- pensate for the dysfunction. Comparisons with exercise studies suggest that the dysfunction in neutrophils also oc- curs in other cells. This is confirmed by the cell-free DNA measurements which indicate levels of tissue damage up to 3.5 times the normal reference range. The major immediate causes of the dysfunction are lack of essential sub- strates and partial blocking of the translocator protein sites in mitochondria. The ATP Profile is a valuable diagnostic tool for the clinical management of ME/CFS.

We also report on the measurement   of   DNA   fragments   in   blood plasma (cell-free DNA), produced as a result of cell damage in ME/CFS.  The ATP Profile as a diagnostic tool for ME/CFS  The ATP Profile consists of several biomedical tests on neutrophils extracted from a 3-ml sam- ple of venous blood. The tests, based on pub- lished research studies, were developed at Bio- lab Medical Unit such that they could be used routinely and reproducibly. In 2009, we pub- lished (we refer to this paper as MBH) our find- ings from an audit where we compared deficien- cies in the provision of ATP (adenosine triphos- phate) in neutrophils with the degree of disabil- ity of patients with ME/CFS by multiplying to- gether 5 of the measured factors to produce a Mitochondrial Energy Score (MES) [3]. The pa- tient group spanned a wide range of CFS Ability from 0 to 7 on the Bell 0 to 10 CFS Ability scale [3, 4]. The results showed a marked correlation between the MES and the degree of CFS Ability. Since then we have carried out a revised analy- sis of that data set. First, we exclude the 10 patients outside the age range 18-65 years of the controls to give Cohort 1 consisting of 61 patients. Secondly, we take into account the fact that one of the 5 factors, TL IN, for some patients is larger than it is for any of the control group. Such behavior is not found for any of the other factors. In addition we present the analy- sis of a second independent set of 138 patients (Cohort 2). Finally, we demonstrate an alterna- tive method of analysis of the test data which provides a complete separation between the patient and control groups. The patients attended a private practice special- izing in ME/CFS and all satisfied the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) diagnostic criteria for CFS [5]. A review of the clinical notes shows that most, if not all, patients also satisfied the more stringent ICCME [2]. Cohort 1 patients had tests and basic interventions to address sleep prob- lems, food intolerances, and thyroid and adre- nal problems. Advice on pacing of activity and stone-age diet was given and simple nutritional supplements were recommended. The patients of Cohort 1 were those who were still ill after these interventions and at this stage the level of disability was assessed jointly by the patient and the clinician using the Bell CFS Ability scale, and a blood sample taken for the ATP Profile test. The nature of the ATP biomedical test was explained and all patients gave written agree- ment for the results to be used anonymously. The patients of Cohort 2 were new patients who had not had this basic work-up package. We expected most of these patients to not be as ill as those of Cohort 1. Because the ATP Profile had been found to be so useful, Cohort 2 pa- tients opted to have this test at their first con- sultation alongside the basic work-up. In the laboratory neutrophils are separated by centrifugation and several biochemical parame- ters measured (fuller details are given in Sec. 2 below and in Appendix B of MBH [3]): 1) Whole cell ATP, which we call ATP Mg   because it is measured by adding excess magnesium (Mg) which is an essential co-factor for the luciferin- luciferase   reaction   (EC   1.13.12.7)   used   to measure   ATP   concentrations.   Standard   and buffer   solutions   and   also   the   equipment   to measure the luminescence produced by the ATP are commercially available. 2) ATP measured with endogenous Mg only, ATP end . Mg is often complexed with ATP and it is an essential co- factor in the hydrolysis reaction in which energy is   released.   Intracellular   Mg   deficiencies   are common in ME/CFS and it is important to meas- ure the ratio ATP end /ATP   Mg   which we call ATP Ratio. 3) Ox Phos, a parameter related to the efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation proc- ess   which   recycles   ADP   (adenosine   diphos- phate) back into ATP. In order to measure this, the inhibitor sodium azide is added to a buffer solution containing the neutrophils. After 3 min. an aliquot is taken and the ATP measured. The ratio gives us % ATP inhibited. This quantity, which was ignored in MBH, has proven to be extremely useful. At this same time the remain- ing cells are washed to remove the inhibitor and 3 min. later the concentration of the recovered ATP   is   measured   and   we   can   calculate   the quantity Ox Phos. 4) TL OUT, a measure of the functionality of the translocator protein (TL or ANT   for   adenine   nucleotide   translocator   or transporter) when its electrogenic antiport faces out to transport ADP into mitochondria for recy- cling. 5) TL IN, a measure of the TL functionality when the antiport faces into the mitochondrial matrix to transport recycled ATP into the cytosol.  Mitochondrial energy score and N fn  In MBH we computed a Mitochondrial Energy Score (MES) by multiplying 5 of the measured\n\nMitoDys & Pathophysiol of ME/CFS  210   Int J Clin Exp Med 2012;5(3):208-220 factors together (ATP Mg , ATP Ratio, Ox Phos, TL OUT, and TL IN) and normalizing all patients and controls to unity (or 100%) at the minimum value for the normal controls [3]. This method seems sound because we have found no strong correlations among these 5 factors. We found that the MES correlates well (correlation coeffi- cient r = 0.80) with CFS Ability and only one pa- tient out of 71 (one out of 61, age range 18-65 of the controls) had a value of MES in the nor- mal region. We also found that just counting up the number of factors N fn   which are in the nor- mal region for each subject also correlates with CFS Ability (r = 0.64). Here we introduce an alternative method. First, we take into account the measurement % ATP inhibited and use it to replace the TL IN factor in the calculation of MES. This solves the problem that TL IN can be higher as well as lower for patients as compared with controls. We label this revised en",

      "fullText": "Introduction We recently reported on an initial audit of a co- hort of 138 patients who attended a private practice specializing in the treatment of ME/ CFS and who had taken the ATP Profile blood test [1]. All patients satisfied the widely used diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [2], and most, if not all, satisfied the Inter- national Consensus Criteria for Myalgic Enceph- alomyelitis (ICCME) [3]. The ATP Profile consists of   several   measurements of   ATP   (Adenosine triphosphate) in neutrophils and their mitochon- dria. The mitochondria carry out the recycling of energy-spent ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) into energy-rich ATP by a series of biochemical reac- tions involving the link reaction, the Krebs citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation which uses the energy provided by the electron trans- fer chain (ETC) to complete the process. Two additional steps are required: the translocation of ADP into the mitochondria and the transloca- tion of ATP out of the mitochondria where most of the energy is required. These processes oc- cur, and provide the energy needed, in all cells in the body, apart from red blood cells. As the first step in measuring the efficiency of oxidative   phosphorylation,   we   added   sodium azide to a suspension of neutrophils in order to inhibit this process. We found that for about ½ of the patients this process was already partially BLOCKED and that an alternative process must be contributing to ATP production. For the other ½ of the patients, the only ATP being made with the azide present was that expected by ongoing glycolysis   in   the   cytosol,   and   there   was   NO BLOCK.

The results revealed that all of these patients had measureable mitochondrial dysfunction. A basic treatment regime, based on 1) eating the evolutionary correct stone-age diet, 2) ensuring optimum hours of good quality sleep, 3) taking a standard package of nutritional supplements, and 4) getting the right balance between work and rest, was recommended for all patients. Additions to the basic regime were tailored for each patient according to the results of the ATP Profile and additional nutritional tests and clues from the clinical history. Mitochondrial function is typically impaired in two ways: substrate or co-factor deficiency, and inhibition by chemicals, exogenous or endoge- nous. For the former, additional nutrients are recommended where there is a deficiency, and for the latter, improve- ment of anti-oxidant status and selective chelation therapy or far-infrared saunas are appropriate. We show case histories of nine patients who have taken the ATP Profile on three or four occasions, and a before-and-after treatment summary of the 34 patients who have had at least two ATP Profile tests separated by some months. Finally, we sum- marize the results for the 30 patients who followed all aspects of the treatment regime and compare them with the 4 patients who were lax on two or more aspects of the treatment regime. All patients who followed the treatment re- gime improved in mitochondrial function by on average a factor of 4. Keywords: Myalgic encephalomyelitis, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Mitochondrial dysfunction, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), Oxidative phosphorylation, Cellular energetics, Nutrition\n\nTreating ME/CFS  2   Int J Clin Exp Med 2013;6(1):1-15 We concluded from this audit and a re-analysis of a previous audit of a cohort of 61 patients in the age range of 18-65 years (Cohort 1) and of 53 controls [4], the following features: 1) All patients of both Cohort 1 (n=61) and Cohort 2 (n=138)   had   measurable   mitochondrial   dys- function. 2) The degree of mitochondrial dys- function correlates with illness severity, as dem- onstrated in our analysis of Cohort 1 [4], and comparison with Cohort 2 [1]. 3) Patients divide into two main groups according to whether oxi- dative phosphorylation is not already blocked, Group   A   (NO BLOCK),   or is   already   partially blocked, Group B (BLOCKED or ‘HI Blk’). We further sub-divide Group A into A1 and A2. 4) For patients in Group A, where there is no prior blocking of oxidative phosphorylation or the re- actions leading up to it, cellular metabolism uses increased glycolysis to partially compen- sate   for   the   dysfunction.   5)   For   patients   in Group B, where there is partial blocking of oxi- dative phosphorylation or a reaction leading up to it, there is an alternative route to increased glycolysis which the cells use to partially com- pensate for the blocking. This route is most likely the adenylate kinase reaction in which two molecules of ADP combine to make one of ATP and one of AMP (Adenosine monophosphate). 6) Tests on isolated mitochondria (parameters TL OUT and TL IN) show that some of the block- ing is due to partial blockages of the transloca- tor proteins, either on the mitochondrial matrix side (TL IN) or the outer membrane (and cyto- sol) side (TL OUT). 7) Group A1: ‘no HIs’ patients appear not to suffer from substrate deficiencies in the processes leading to ATP delivery, while those in Group A2: ‘HI TL IN’ have substrate deficiencies. The latter conclusion comes from the measured super-normal values of the pa- rameter TL IN. 8) Comparisons with some pub- lished exercise studies, which also indicate two groups, suggest that the dysfunction that we observe in neutrophils may also occur in other cells such as those of skeletal muscle [1]. 9) The degree of dysfunction in neutrophils corre- lates with auxiliary measurements of cell-free DNA in blood plasma which indicate levels of tissue damage up to 3.5 times the upper level of the normal reference range. This is clearly demonstrated in figure 6 of our previous paper on the pathophysiology [1]. The cell-free DNA is a measure of non-apoptotic tissue breakdown [5]. 10) The major immediate causes of the mi- tochondrial dysfunction are: a) lack of substrate, and b) partial blocking of the translocator pro- tein sites and/or oxidative phosphorylation and the reactions leading up to it (link reaction and Krebs cycle). In this paper we will show that the ATP Profile is a valuable diagnostic and clinical management tool for ME/CFS. This is possible because 34 of the 138 patients of Cohort 2 have undergone a repeat ATP Profile after some months of treat- ment and we can compare their subsequent test results with their initial ones. The ATP Profile  Test procedure  Full details of the testing procedure and how the quantities are measured have been pub- lished [1, 4] and will not be repeated here. How- ever, we will list the main quantities: ATP Mg   : the whole cell concentration of ATP in units of fmol/ cell, measured with the addition of excess mag- nesium (Mg); ATP end   : the concentration of ATP complexed with endogenous Mg; ATP Ratio: the ratio ATP   end /ATP   Mg   which indicates whether or not there is a Mg deficiency; % ATP inhibited: the percentage decrease of whole cell ATP when an inhibitor of the ETC is added; Ox Phos: a measure of the efficiency of the oxidative phos- phorylation   process   which   is   calculated   by measuring the fraction of whole cell ATP recov- ered when the inhibitor is removed; TL OUT: a measure of the functionality of the translocator protein TL when its electrogenic antiport faces out to transport ADP into mitochondria for recy- cling; TL IN: a measure of the functionality of TL when its antiport faces into the mitochondrial matrix to transport recycled ATP into the cytosol. This is the situation when its value is in the nor- mal region, or below normal. In some cases it has a super-normal value, and we interpret this as being due to lack of substrate within the mi- tochondria [1]. Each one of these quantities has an experimen- tal minimum value and maximum value for the control group, and Ox Phos and % ATP inhibited are constrained to be not larger than unity (or 100%). Usually the values for patients are within the normal range or below it. The exception is TL IN which sometimes has super-normal values (hence the label ‘HI TL IN’) which we interpret as being due to lack of one or more substrates within the mitochondria.\n\nTreating ME/CFS  3   Int J Clin Exp Med 2013;6(1):1-15 The total cellular concentration of ATP is not a useful   measure   of   mitochondrial   dysfunction [6]. As an overall measure of the efficiency for ATP production and recycling, and one which correlates well with the degree of patient ability, we use 6 of these 7 quantities (ATP   end   is already included in ATP   Mg   and ATP Ratio) to calculate what we call the Mitochondrial Energy Score, MES inh , by evaluating the product of these quan- tities, dividing this figure by the minimum value of the controls for this product and then finally multiplying by 100 to convert to %. All of the 53 controls have values of MES inh   of 100% or more (up to 257%) with an average of (144 ± 29)% where the error is the standard deviation (SD). Figure 1A shows a histogram of the MES inh   val- ues for the control group, and the dotted verti- cal line indicates the mean value.  Auxiliary tests  As well as the ATP Profile, many of the patients take other tests including that of Cell free DNA in blood plasma.

Keywords:   cardiopulmonary exercise test; chronic fatigue syndrome; myalgic encephalomyelitis; postexertional malaise  1. Introduction  Myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS) is a debilitating multisystem disease that a ff ects more than 20 million people of all ages and races worldwide [   1 ,   2 ]. The core symptoms are severe fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional malaise (PEM), and cognitive dysfunction for more than 6 months [   3 ]. Approximately 30% of the patients are housebound, and 50% are unable to work full time [ 4 ]. Despite the seriousness of the illness, ME / CFS has no established pathophysiology or diagnostic tests yet [   4   ]. Moreover, the diagnosis of ME / CFS is often confused with other fatigue-related or comorbid illnesses (e.g., depression) due to the overlapping symptoms [5]. Although the clinical presentation of ME / CFS can be ambiguous, a 2015 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) states that PEM is a hallmark of this disease and helps distinguish it from other conditions [ 3 ]. PEM consists of exertional intolerance and worsening of symptoms following minor physical or cognitive exertion, which can be severe enough to leave the patients bedridden [ 6   , 7 ]. Studies on the prevalence of PEM in ME / CFS reported that more than 80% of all ME / CFS patients had  J. Clin. Med.   2020 ,   9 , 4040; doi:10.3390 / jcm9124040   www.mdpi.com / journal / jcm\n\nJ. Clin. Med.   2020 ,   9 , 4040   2 of 13  experienced this symptom at some point in their illness [ 8 ,   9 ]. The underlying pathophysiology of PEM is not clearly understood, but researchers have adapted the two-day cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) as a strategy for objectively measuring PEM [3,10–12]. The CPET was developed as a tool to measure the functional capacity of the body through analysis of gas exchange (e.g., oxygen, and carbon dioxide) during exercise for athletes and people with cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, and metabolic disorders [ 13   ]. In general, the CPET is performed on a single day for the above purposes; however, the two-day CPET has received attention particularly for ME / CFS since 2007 [ 10 ]. It can assess recovery capacity using two exercise tests administered 24 h apart [   14   ]. A number of one-day CPET studies reported a lack of significant di ff erences between ME / CFS patients and controls [   15   –   18 ]; however, significantly di ff erent responses were observed in the 2nd test of the two-day CPET [ 10   ,   19 ,   20   ]. This may indicate impaired recovery, reduced energy production, and likely PEM in ME / CFS patients [ 14   ]. Multiple studies have reported an association with mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential pathophysiology in ME / CFS patients [21,22]. A previous review study assessed one parameter (the volume of oxygen consumption at peak, VO 2peak ) between ME / CFS patients and controls by combining the two di ff erent tests (one-day and two-day CPET studies) [ 23   ]. However, considering the possible di ff erences in the results of one-day and two-day CPET, two-day CPET data may need to be analyzed separately in various parameters. Therefore, we meta-analyzed the parameters of VO 2   and workload both at peak (VO 2peak , Workload peak ) and at ventilatory threshold (VO 2 @VT, Workload@VT) in two-day CPET studies to assess the potential use of this test as a diagnostic tool for ME / CFS.  2. Methods  2.1. Search Strategy, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  We conducted a systematic search in five public databases and two search sources: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Google Scholar, a hand search, and the reference lists of the included studies. The search was conducted from February to June 2020. The search keywords were ‘Chronic fatigue syndrome’ [MeSH terms] AND ‘cardiopulmonary exercise test’ or ‘CEPT’ [MeSH terms]. For the Google Scholar search in particular, we restricted the search criteria to reduce the initial abundant numbers and selected the studies not searched by PubMed. Papers were screened using the following inclusion criteria: (a) studies of cross-sectional, case–control, prospective studies that conducted the CPET to measure diagnostic parameters for ME / CFS, (b) two-day CPET with the two sessions conducted 24 h apart, (c) studies that measured the four parameters (VO 2peak , Workload peak , VO 2 @VT, and Workload@VT) for the test.   The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) non clinical-based studies, (b) studies for other than ME / CFS, and studies with (c) single CPET, (d) no controls and that failed to state the four parameter values, (e) less than 5 participants, (f) studies that measured other than the four parameters. The search and data extraction were performed by E-J. L. and C-G. S., and any disagreements were resolved by discussions.  2.2. Data Extraction and Outcome Measures  The main features of the studies were extracted and compiled including; authors, year of publication, and the number of participants, the age and body mass index (BMI) of the participants, and the methodology of selecting the participants (Table 1). The primary outcome measures were the four parameters: VO 2peak , Workload peak , VO 2 @VT, and Workload@VT. These parameters are involved in measuring activity limitations of ME / CFS patients [ 24   ]. These are defined as follows: (1) VO 2peak   is the highest value of oxygen uptake obtained during the exercise. (2) VO 2   at ventilatory threshold (VT) is the volume of oxygen at VT, which is the point which ventilation starts to increase at a faster rate than oxygen consumption. (3) Workload peak   is the power output produced by the participant at peak. (4) Workload@VT is the level of power output produced at VT [11,14].\n\nJ. Clin. Med.   2020 ,   9 , 4040   3 of 13  2.3. Statistical Analysis  We calculated the mean di ff erence and meta-analyzed the four parameters of ME / CFS patients and controls as of Testes 1 and 2 (Tables 2–4). The four parameters was estimated with a random-e ff ects model to account for the heterogeneity of the data, and we compared the   I 2   and significance ( p   values) of those groups.   I 2   higher than 50% is considered substantially heterogeneous [ 25   ]. A forest plot was used to show the estimated overall mean number of the parameters, and   p   value   <   0.05 is considered significant. The data were analyzed using the meta-analysis program version 5.3 Review Manager (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) [26].  2.4. Assessment of Quality of Studies  The quality of studies included was assessed according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) guideline for case-control studies, which judges studies on the following perspectives: selection of the groups, the comparability of the groups, and the ascertainment of exposure [27] (Table 1).  3. Results  3.1. Characteristics of Included Studies  In total, 218 studies were initially selected as candidates for this meta-analysis; ultimately, 5 studies were included (Figure 1). All studies used the same study protocol (an incremental cycling protocol with an interval of 24 h) and case definition (Fukuda) for inclusion of participants.   Two studies additionally used the International Consensus Criteria (ICC) [ 28   ] and / or the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) [   6   ]. The total number of participants across the five studies was 98 ME / CFS patients (90 female and 8 male) and 51 controls (45 female and 6 male). The total mean age and BMI of the participants were comparable between the patient and control groups (Table 1). in measuring activity limitations of ME/CFS patients [24].

Abstract:   Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic, debilitating, and multi-faceted illness. Heterogenous onset and clinical presentation with additional comorbidities make it difficult to diagnose, characterize, and successfully treat.   Current treatment guidelines focus on symptom management, but with no clear target or causative mechanism, remission rates are low, and fewer than 5% of patients return to their pre-morbid activity levels. Therefore, there is an urgent need to undertake robust clinical trials to identify effective treatments. This review synthesizes insights from clinical trials exploring pharmacological interventions and dietary sup- plements targeting immunological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and neuroendocrine dysfunction in ME/CFS patients which require further exploration. Additionally, the trialling of alternative interventions in ME/CFS based on reported efficacy in the treatment of illnesses with overlapping symptomology is also discussed. Finally, we provide important considerations and make recommendations, focusing on outcome measures, to ensure the execution of future high-quality clinical trials to establish clinical efficacy of evidence-based interventions that are needed for adoption in clinical practice.

Introduction  Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating and heterogenous illness that affects between 17–24 million people worldwide [   1 ]. Diagnosing ME/CFS remains challenging due to no available tests or biomarker [   2 ]. A causative agent has not been identified, with patients reporting a range of events occurring prior to the onset of ME/CFS, including infectious illnesses, stress, or major life events and exposure to chemical or environmental toxins [   3 ]. Variations in symptoms and severity, the presence of  J. Clin. Med.   2024 ,   13 , 325. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13020325   https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\n\nJ. Clin. Med.   2024 ,   13 , 325   2 of 27  comorbid illnesses, and the large number of ME/CFS case definitions further contribute to the heterogeneity among ME/CFS patients [   4 –   6 ]. Consequently, it has been challenging for researchers to identify consistent pathophysiological changes that occur across all ME/CFS patients with our understanding of disturbances in the immune, metabolic, gastrointestinal (GI), nervous, and endocrine systems remaining incomplete [   7   ]. There is currently no cure or FDA-recommended treatment for ME/CFS. Consequently, fewer than 5% of patients return to their pre-morbid activity levels [ 3 ]. ME/CFS has a substantial economic burden due to healthcare costs and loss of productivity [   8 ], with 75% of patients unable to work [   9 ] and 25% confined to their house or bed [10]. In the past, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) were recommended by health agencies for the treatment of ME/CFS [ 11 ]. Reanalysis of the 2011 PACE (pacing, graded activity, and cognitive behaviour therapy; a randomised evaluation) trial refuted original claims of the safety and efficacy of GET and CBT (reviewed in [   12   ]). Consequently, treatment guidelines have undergone revisions, removing GET as a recommended therapy, while CBT is now provided as a supplementary approach to alleviate the distress related to chronic illness [ 13   –   15 ]. Health agencies recommend a multidisciplinary, individualised approach to treat or manage the symptoms patients experience, utilising both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments [   13 ,   14   ]. In addition, comorbid illnesses such as anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia (FM), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and migraine headaches are common in ME/CFS patients [ 3   ]. Treatment and management of comorbid illnesses need to be considered carefully, due to some recommended treatments for the comorbid illnesses having detrimental effects on ME/CFS symptoms [13,15]. This review evaluates past clinical trials (CTs) in ME/CFS, identifying gaps requiring further investigation and providing recommendations for planning and designing robust future CTs into ME/CFS.  2. Infection  Reports of outbreaks and sporadic cases of ME/CFS have suggested infections as po- tential triggers for the disease [ 16   ,   17 ]. Herpesviruses, particularly Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 types A and B (HHV-6), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are the most likely viruses associated with ME/CFS   [18–20] based on findings of increased viral load and virus-specific antibody titres [   19   , 21   , 22   ]. Her- pesvirus reactivation may contribute to ME/CFS pathophysiology via inflammation and immune dysregulation [ 23   , 24   ]. CTs have evaluated the effect of antiviral therapy and immunomodulators in ME/CFS patients (Table S1).  2.1. Nucleoside Analogues  Nucleoside analogues used for the treatment of herpesviruses consist of a “prodrug” that is selectively metabolized by viral thymidine kinase to its active form, which inhibits viral replication [ 25   ,   26   ]. The first antiviral based on a nucleoside analogue tested in ME/CFS patients was acyclovir (ACV) [   25 –   27   ], active against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) but less so against EBV and HCMV [ 28   ]. A double-blind, cross-over, placebo- controlled study administrating intravenous ACV for one month to twenty-four ME/CFS patients revealed no significant improvement in symptoms compared to placebo [ 27   ]. Given the low solubility in water, low oral bioavailability, and short plasma half-life of ACV, more soluble forms were developed, like the L-valyl ester from ACV, termed valacyclovir (VACV) [   25 ]. VACV has improved GI absorption and is three times more orally bioavailable than ACV [   25 ,   26   ]. Two pilot studies found administering VACV over six months improved physical activity in ME/CFS patients with elevated EBV antibodies [ 29   , 30   ].   However, patients with elevated HCMV antibodies did not improve [29]. Another antiviral structurally related to ACV is ganciclovir (GCV). Limited oral bioavailability of GCV prompted the development of its valine ester, valganciclovir (VGCV), with improved GI absorption [   31 ]. The benefits of VGCV treatment were evidenced in (i) a\n\nJ. Clin. Med.   2024 ,   13 , 325   3 of 27  24-week open-label pilot study (OPT) performed in twelve ME/CFS patients with elevated antibody titres to both HHV-5 and EBV [ 32 ], (ii) a review of medical records of ME/CFS patients with positive EBV, HHV-6, and HCMV serum antibody titres administered VGCV for at least 6 months [ 33   ], (iii) a retrospective chart review performed on sixty-one ME/CFS patients with high HHV-6 and EBV antibody titres for 3 weeks [   34 ], and (iv) a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) performed in thirty ME/CFS patients with high HHV-6 and EBV antibody titres for 6 months [   35 ]. Of note, some studies reported a severe initial worsening of ME/CFS symptoms that subsequently improved [ 32 ,   33 ,   35   ]. Otherwise, no severe effects have been reported. A recent retrospective study comparing the efficacy in treating reactivated HHV-6 and HHV-7 infections with VACV, VGCV, and artesunate, an antiviral that targets both the herpesvirus and susceptible host cell, found that all antivirals were able to reduce HHV-6 and HHV-7 levels in ME/CFS patients, with artesunate being the most effective [36].  2.2.

Abstract:   Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic, debilitating, and multi-faceted illness. Heterogenous onset and clinical presentation with additional comorbidities make it difficult to diagnose, characterize, and successfully treat.   Current treatment guidelines focus on symptom management, but with no clear target or causative mechanism, remission rates are low, and fewer than 5% of patients return to their pre-morbid activity levels. Therefore, there is an urgent need to undertake robust clinical trials to identify effective treatments. This review synthesizes insights from clinical trials exploring pharmacological interventions and dietary sup- plements targeting immunological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and neuroendocrine dysfunction in ME/CFS patients which require further exploration. Additionally, the trialling of alternative interventions in ME/CFS based on reported efficacy in the treatment of illnesses with overlapping symptomology is also discussed. Finally, we provide important considerations and make recommendations, focusing on outcome measures, to ensure the execution of future high-quality clinical trials to establish clinical efficacy of evidence-based interventions that are needed for adoption in clinical practice.

Introduction  Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating and heterogenous illness that affects between 17–24 million people worldwide [   1 ]. Diagnosing ME/CFS remains challenging due to no available tests or biomarker [   2 ]. A causative agent has not been identified, with patients reporting a range of events occurring prior to the onset of ME/CFS, including infectious illnesses, stress, or major life events and exposure to chemical or environmental toxins [   3 ].

Myalgic   encephalomyelitis: International Consensus Criteria (Review).   J Intern Med   2011;   270 : 327–338. The label ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’ (CFS) has per- sisted for many years because of the lack of knowl- edge of the aetiological agents and the disease pro- cess. In view of more recent research and clinical experience that strongly point to widespread inflam- mation and multisystemic neuropathology, it is more appropriate and correct to use the term ‘myalgic encephalomyelitis’   (ME)   because   it   indicates   an underlying pathophysiology. It is also consistent with the neurological classification of ME in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD G93.3). Consequently, an Interna- tional   Consensus   Panel   consisting   of   clinicians, researchers, teaching faculty and an independent  Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Terms and Conditions set out at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com/online open#OnlineOpen_Terms  ª   2011 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine   327  Review   |\n\npatient advocate was formed with the purpose of developing criteria based on current knowledge. Thir- teen countries and a wide range of specialties were represented. Collectively, members have approxi- mately 400 years of both clinical and teaching experi- ence, authored hundreds of peer-reviewed publica- tions, diagnosed or treated approximately 50 000 patients with ME, and several members coauthored previous criteria. The expertise and experience of the panel members as well as PubMed and other medical sources were utilized in a progression of sugges- tions   ⁄   drafts   ⁄   reviews   ⁄   revisions. The authors, free of any sponsoring organization, achieved 100% consen- sus through a Delphi-type process. The scope of this paper is limited to criteria of ME and their application. Accordingly, the criteria reflect the complex symp- tomatology. Operational notes enhance clarity and specificity by providing guidance in the expression and interpretation of symptoms. Clinical and re- search application guidelines promote optimal recog- nition of ME by primary physicians and other health- care providers, improve the consistency of diagnoses in adult and paediatric patients internationally and facilitate clearer identification of patients for research studies.  Keywords:   chronic fatigue syndrome, criteria, defini- tion, diagnosis, myalgic encephalomyelitis.  Introduction  Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also referred to in the literature as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is a complex disease involving profound dysregulation of the central nervous system (CNS) [1–3] and immune system [4–8], dysfunction of cellular energy metabo- lism and ion transport [9–11] and cardiovascular abnormalities [12–14]. The underlying pathophysiol- ogy produces measurable abnormalities in physical and   cognitive   function   and   provides   a   basis   for understanding the symptomatology. Thus, the devel- opment   of   International   Consensus   Criteria   that incorporate current knowledge should advance the understanding of ME by health practitioners and benefit both the physician and patient in the clinical setting as well as clinical researchers. The problem with broadly inclusive criteria [15, 16] is that they do not select homogeneous sets of patients. The Centers for Disease Control prevalence estimates increased tenfold from 0.24% using the Fukuda crite- ria [17] to 2.54% using the Reeves empirical criteria [16]. Jason   et al.   [18] suggest that there are flaws in Reeves’ methodology because it is possible to meet the empirical criteria for ME without having any physical symptoms and it does not discriminate pa- tients with ME   ⁄   CFS from those with major depressive disorder. Patient sets that include people who do not have the disease lead to biased research findings, inappropriate treatments and waste scarce research funds [19]. Some symptoms of the Fukuda criteria overlap with depression, whereas the Canadian Consensus Crite- ria [20] differentiate patients with ME from those who are depressed and identify patients who are more physically debilitated and have greater physical and cognitive functional impairments [21].  International Consensus Criteria  The Canadian Consensus Criteria were used as a starting point, but significant changes were made. The 6-month waiting period before diagnosis is no longer required. No other disease criteria require that diagnoses be withheld until after the patient has suffered with the affliction for 6 months. Notwith- standing periods of clinical investigation will vary and may be prolonged, diagnosis should be made when the clinician is satisfied that the patient has ME rather than having the diagnosis restricted by a specified time factor. Early diagnoses may elicit new insights   into   the   early   stages   of   pathogenes",

To understand immune dysregulation in ME/CFS, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to examine immune cells in patient and control cohorts. Postexertional malaise (PEM), an exacerbation of symptoms following strenuous exercise, is a characteristic symptom of ME/CFS. To detect changes coinci- dent with PEM, we applied scRNA-seq on the same cohorts following exercise. At baseline, ME/CFS patients display classical monocyte dysregulation suggestive of inappropriate differentiation and migration to tissue. We identify both diseased and more normal monocytes within patients, and the fraction of diseased cells cor- relates with disease severity. Comparing the transcriptome at baseline and postexercise challenge, we discover patterns indicative of improper platelet activation in patients, with minimal changes elsewhere in the immune system. Taken together, these data identify immunological defects present at baseline in pa- tients and an additional layer of dysregulation in platelets.  INTRODUCTION  Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious human disease that lacks effective treatment options and affects   \u0018 65 million individuals worldwide.   1,2   Our minimal un- derstanding of ME/CFS hinders diagnosis, rational approaches to treatment, and development of a cure. Multiple lines of evi- dence implicate a role for the immune system in ME/CFS. 3   For example, transforming growth factor   b , a cytokine that confers both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals depending on the micro- environment,   4   has been   reported   to   be upregulated   in   the plasma of ME/CFS patients.   5,6   Elevated levels of multiple proin- flammatory   cytokines   have   been   correlated   with   disease severity, and activation patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines differentiate early cases versus those of longer dura- tion. 7   Together, these results suggest that ME/CFS involves the dysregulation of immune cells. Immune cells of both the innate and adaptive systems are thought to be dysregulated in ME/CFS. Monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells have been reported to exhibit alterations in pro- portions and surface markers in ME/CFS. 8,9   Neutrophils exhibit elevated apoptosis in ME/CFS patients.   10   T lymphocytes also display abnormal metabolism and cytokine production,   11   and other studies have implicated B cell alterations in ME/CFS. 12,13 However, previous studies have examined immune cells in isola- tion and often across small cohorts. Moreover, heterogeneous immune   cell   populations   have   typically   been   characterized as   bulk   samples,   compromising   the   ability   to   distinguish changes that affect only specific cell subsets. These limitations, together with the heterogeneous nature of the disease,   14   have likely contributed to the contradictory results between studies.   15 Thus, at present, it is far from clear which components of the im- mune system are the most relevant to ME/CFS. A defining symptom of ME/CFS is postexertional malaise (PEM), an exacerbation of symptoms resulting from exertion. Un- derstanding changes that occur in immune cell populations dur- ing PEM could provide useful insights into the disease, and the development of potential treatment and preventive approaches. An established method of inducing PEM in ME/CFS is with car- diopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs), which monitor multiple  Cell Reports Medicine   5 , 101373, January 16, 2024   ª   2023 The Authors.   1  This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).  ll  OPEN ACCESS\n\nparameters during a controlled exercise period with increasing intensity until exhaustion or limiting symptoms appear.   16   Incor- porating CPET into ME/CFS studies provides objective physio- logical parameters, increasing confidence in diagnosis. ME/CFS has been proposed to result from infection by an un- known virus (or other pathogen), leading to the disease in sus- ceptible individuals. This theory derives from the many occur- rences of clustered cases of the disease,   17   together with the observation that many patients reported experiencing a flu-like or other infection before disease onset. It is unknown whether only specific viruses can trigger ME/CFS or whether many vi- ruses can induce the disease, although accumulating evidence implicates   enteroviruses.   18,19   Notably,   ME/CFS   and   long COVID (coronavirus disease 2019) share many, although not all, symptoms   20   ; thus, there may be commonalities between the diseases, including a viral origin. However, the degree to which molecular signatures are shared by ME/CFS and long COVID is unknown. Therefore, the knowledge gained in under- standing   ME/CFS   may   be   of   significance   regarding   long COVID and vice versa. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to examine immune cells within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ME/CFS patients and matched controls. Our goals were to identify immune cell types with dysregulated tran- scriptomes in ME/CFS, and also recognize cell types that show no substantial differences between the patient and control co- horts to rule out their involvement in the disease state. Finally, because PEM is a defining symptom of ME/CFS, we performed scRNA-seq both before and after exercise challenge (CPET), with the goal of characterizing changes that occur during PEM. We observed extensive alterations in the transcriptome of a sub- set of monocytes in ME/CFS patients, with largely identical alter- ations present at baseline (BL) and 24 h after the exercise chal- lenge. Indeed, most gene dysregulation across the ME/CFS immune system was consistent between the BL and postexer- cise conditions. In contrast to this general property of the ME/ CFS   immune   system,   we   observed   marked   differences   in platelet transcriptomes from patients at BL compared to post- CPET (PC), suggesting that aberrant platelet activity is associ- ated with PEM. Taken together, this study identifies cell types with distinctive patterns of transcriptome dysregulation; these data suggest new hypotheses for understanding ME/CFS and the role of PEM.  RESULTS Single-cell transcriptomics of the ME/CFS immune system  Despite evidence that immune dysregulation is a major feature of ME/CFS, the components of the immune system most involved in the disease are unknown. To address this question, we used the   10X   platform   to   perform   scRNA-seq   to   profile   \u0018 5,000 PMBCs per sample from a cohort of 30 patients and 28 controls, matched for sex and BMI and differing in parameters character- istic of ME/CFS (Figures 1A and 1B; Data S1). Samples were ob- tained before the COVID-19 pandemic, eliminating the possibility that any patients had long COVID rather than ME/CFS. Because PEM is a defining symptom of ME/CFS, we profiled samples from all of the individuals at BL and 24 h after a strenuous exer- cise challenge   21,22   (PC; Figure 1A). This design has the potential to define gene dysregulation in immune cells at BL in patients as well as dysregulation associated with PEM. We used a two-step strategy   to   sequence   each   library   to   equivalent   coverage,. First, we sequenced each scRNA-seq library at low coverage (averaging 57 million reads) and used these data to determine the sequencing depth required to obtain a depth of over 4,000 unique   molecular   identifiers   per   cell,   for   a   total   average sequencing depth of 136 million reads per sample. Datasets were integrated with Seurat version 4   23   to generate a landscape for cell-type annotation and comparisons between samples. Standard scRNA-seq metrics ",

PEM is also a feature of Long COVID.   Dynamic  m easures of PEM have historically included scaled questionnaires which have   not   been validated  in ME/CFS. To enhance our understanding of PEM   and how best to measure it ,   we conducted  semi - structured   qualitative   interviews   (QIs)   at the same intervals as V isual   A nalog   S cale (VAS)  measures   after   a   C ardiopulmonary Exercise Test   (CPET) .  Methods:   Ten ME/CFS and   nine   healthy volunteers participated in a CPET. For each  participant,   PEM symptom   VAS   (7 symptoms)   and semi - structured   QIs   were administered at   six  timepoints   over 72 hours   before and after   a single   CPET.   QI data were used to plot the   severity  of   PEM   at each t ime point   and identify   the   self - described most bothersome symptom   for each  patient .   QI data w ere   used to determine the symptom trajectory and peak of PEM. Performance  of QI and VAS data were compared to each other using   Spearman correlations .  Results:   Q I s   documented that each ME/CFS   volunteer had a   unique PEM experience , with  differences noted in   the   onset,   severity,   trajectory   over time,   and   most bothersome symptom. No  h ealthy volunteers experience d   PEM .   Scal ed   QI   data   w ere   able to identify PEM peaks and  trajectories , even   when VAS   scales were unable to do so due to known   ceiling   and floor   effects.  QI and VAS fatigue data corresponded   well   prior to exercise   ( baseline,   r=0.7)   but   poorly at p eak  PEM   ( r= 0 .28 )   and with the change from baseline to peak (r=0.20) .   When the most bothersome  symptom identified from QIs was used,   t hese c orrelations   improved   (r= . 0.77, 0.42. and 0.54  respectively)   and reduced the observed VAS scale ceiling and floor effects.  Conclusio n:   QIs were able to capture changes in PEM severity   and symptom quality   over time  in all the ME/CFS volunteers, even when VAS scales failed to do so. Information collected from  QIs also improved the performance of   VAS . Measurement of PEM can be improved by using a  quantitative - qualitative mixed model approach.  for use under a CC0 license.

INTRODUCTION  Persistent and disabling fatigue, exercise intolerance, cognitive difficulties, and  myalgias/arthralgias   are characteristic of a   medical   disorder referred to as   M yalgic  E ncephalomyelitis / C hronic   F atigue   S yndrome (ME/CFS). Post exertional malaise (PEM) is a n  acute   worsening of these symptoms after minimal physical or mental exertion   (1) .   PEM patients  describe   the experience   as   all - encompassing   with symptoms affecting every part of the body ,  difficult to predict or manage, and requiring complete bedrest to recover.   More recently,  evidence has emerged of PEM in persons with long COVID ( 2,3) .   While PEM has a wide range  of symptoms , three core symptoms have been identified:   exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, and  neuromuscular complaints   ( 4 ).   Al though PEM   is   considered a central feature of ME/CFS   ( 5 )   its  assessment   is   challenging due to   its   su bjective nature   and   a   lack of validated tools for reliable  quantification .   Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an important tool for   the   evaluati o n  of   patients with ME/CFS   ( 5 , 6 )   and   is   used to induce PEM in research settings.   The quality and  depth of severity   of   PEM   experienced by patients after undergoing   CPET can be gleaned from  the words of one of our ME/CFS pa tients : “[After CPET] I go into this shutdown mode. I am  aware of what’s g oing on around me…but I need to save energy. So I’ll point to things and if I  need to say some words, I’ll say them. I laid down right away… Everybody was doing all sorts  of things around me…and I just didn’t talk.”   The development of a scale that can accu rately   and  reliably   capture how this severe symptomatic experience evolves over time is an essential first  step to understanding the biology of PEM.  Historically ,   Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS )   ha ve   been widely used for monitoring the course of  chronic dise ase s   and capturing changes due to medical interventions and ha ve   been validated for  detecting pain in several patient populations   ( 7 - 9 ). In the ME/CFS patient population ,   VAS and  Numeric Rating Scales ( NRS )   have been employed to detect differences in physical fatigue,  mental fatigue, and painful symptoms between patients and healthy controls following stress  imposed by exercise or orthostatic testing ( 10 - 1 6 ). Cu rrent scales   are known   to produce   ceiling  effec ts and   are   sensitiv e   to minor variability in wording   when measuring PEM   ( 1 7 - 1 9 ).   Further  complicating measurement   i s the characteristically delayed onset   of PEM .   PEM   in ME/CFS  patients   following CPET   peak s   within hours to days   afterward   with a   duration of several days or  longer   ( 4 ,   20 ,   21 ).   Measuring the evolution of PEM requires p oint - in - time measurement s, which  have been performed to date with   VAS   and   NRS   ( 6 , 2 2 , 2 3 ) .   Both of t hese   types of   measurement  tools are psychometric response scales us ed to measure symptom severity   at a point - in - time   in  for use under a CC0 license.

N either   type   has been validated for measurement of PEM .  While the recently developed DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) has provided the field   a  validated   tool for assessing PEM in ME/CFS patients ( 1 7 ,   1 9 , 2 7 ), the   instrument uses   lengthy  recall period s   and   was   not designed to capture PEM   in real time .   A   variety of   other   retrospective  questionnaires have been used to capture   PEM   symptom breadth ,   severity ,   and duration ,   such as  the   Patient - Reported   O utcomes Measurement Information   S ystem ( P ROMIS ) ,   Short Form 36  H ealth Survey Questionnaire ( SF - 36 ) ,   C hronic   F atigue   Q uestionnaire (CFQ),   and   Fatigue Impact  Scale (FIS)   ( 1 9 ,   2 8 , 2 9 ) .   Many of t hese   instruments use lengthy   temporal   intervals   in symptom  assessment,   such as   seven   days,   thirty   days, or   six   months ,   and   thus   are unsuitable for measuring  moment - to - moment   changes in PEM.  Open - ended questionnaires have been used to capture PEM following CPET. For instance,  Twomey et al.   ( 30 )   used a   shorter recall period by   providing   participants   an open - ended  questionnaire 96 hours after exercise testing with instructions to recall the previous   four   days.  Other   studies   have used open - ended questionnaires to   collect point - in - time measurement of PEM  following exercise testing   by   providing the quest ionnaires ahead of time and   instructi ng   patients  to   answer questions at   several timepoints following the   exercise   test ( 11 ,   31 ).   These types of  r etrospective methodolog ies   and the use of predetermined questions   are unavoidably   subject   to  recall bias and cannot fully capture the   individualistic nature and complexity of   PEM   ( 4 , 1 7 , 1 8 ,  20 ).  A n interactive assessment allowing for   p robing   and   clarifying   the breadth and severity of  symptom s   at a point - in - time   during the experimental initiation of PEM is an   important step  toward the discovery of biological correlates .   Qualitative   interviews   (QI s )   afford   patients the  opportunity to fully   delineate   the breadth and complexity of the   experience of PEM without  being confined   to   ",

This study builds on previous work showing that mitochondrial respiratory parameters are impaired in whole cells from CFS patients by investigating the activity of individual mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Two different cell types were used in these studies in order to assess individual complex activity locally in the skeletal muscle (myotubes) ( n   =   6) and systemically (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) (control   n   =   6; CFS   n   =   13). Complex I, II and IV activity and respiratory activitysupported by fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis were measured usingextracellular flux analysis. Cells were permeabilised and combinations of substrates and inhibitors were added throughout the assays to allow states of mitochondrial respiration to be calculated and the activity of specific aspects of respiratory activity to be measured. Results showed there to be no significant differences in individual mitochondrial complex activity or respiratory activity supported by fatty acid oxidation or glutaminolysis between healthy control and CFS cohorts in either skeletal muscle ( p   ≥   0 . 190) or PBMCs ( p   ≥   0 . 065). This is the first study to use extracellular flux analysisto investigate individual mitochondrial complex activity in permeabilised cells in the context of CFS. The lack of difference in complex activity in CFS PBMCs suggests that the previously observed mitochondrial dysfunction in whole PBMCs is due to causes upstream of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

CFS has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with key symptoms including severe fatigue and post-exertional malaise ( Hvidberg et al., 2015 ;   Winger et al., 2015 ). The mechanisms behind the aetiopathogenesis of CFS are yet to be elucidated. The lack of  How to cite this article   Tomas C, Brown AE, Newton JL, Elson JL. 2019. Mitochondrial complex activity in permeabilised cells of chronic fatigue syndrome patients using two cell types.   PeerJ   7 :e6500 http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6500\n\nknowledge of the mechanisms behind the disease contribute to difficulty in obtaining a consensus on diagnostic criteria and the development of widely effective treatments. Various aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction have previously been postulated as contributing to CFS ( Tomas et al., 2017 ;   Booth, Myhill & McLaren-Howard, 2012 ;   Myhill, Booth & McLaren-Howard, 2009 ;   Myhill, Booth & McLaren-Howard, 2013 ;   Lawson et al., 2016 ;   Behan, More & Behan, 1991 ;   Morris & Maes, 2014 ;   Filler et al., 2014 ). Fatigue has been shown to be common in patients with primary mitochondrial disease ( Gorman et al., 2015 ); however, it should be noted that patients with CFS are not seen to harbour primary mitochondrial mutations ( Schoeman et al., 2017 ).   Billing-Ross et al. (2016)   showed that certain changes in the mitochondrial genome increases the likelihood of specific symptoms in CFS patients such as gastrointestinal, neurological, and inflammatory symptoms, however, these genomic changes do not make patients more susceptible to developing the disease. Previous studies have shown the energy production, including mitochondrial activity, of whole PBMCs from CFS patients to be significantly impaired compared to a healthy control cohort ( Tomas et al., 2017 ;   Fluge et al., 2016 ). One study, using extracellular flux analysis in whole cells, showed CFS PBMCs to have significantly impaired mitochondrial functioning both under basal conditions and when maximally stimulated to respire, under a number of experimental conditions ( Tomas et al., 2017 ). This suggested that CFS patients were unable to utilise mitochondrial energy production to the same extent as healthy controls and implied that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The study presented here was conducted in order to further investigate if the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in CFS PBMCs was due to atypical activity of individual mitochondrial complexes using the same technique as the previous study (extracellular flux analysis) but in permeabilsied cells rather than whole cells. The use of permeabilised cells allows mitochondria to be directly accessed by the substrates with no cellular interference in terms of substrate transport or intracellular interactions. The permeabilisation of cells also allows the enzymatic activity of individual respiratory chain complexes to be to be measured which cannot be done easily in whole cells. This study investigates the activity of individual complexes and components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in myotubes and PBMCs—myotubes were used to investigate mitochondrial activity locally in the skeletal muscle, while PBMCs were used to investigate mitochondrial complex activity systemically. This was achieved by permeabilising cells ensuring that the mitochondria remained intact and using extracellular flux analysis to record oxygen consumption rate of cells following the serial injection of mitochondrial activity altering compounds. Respiratory parameters were calculated and compared between control and CFS derived muscle cells and PBMCs. For this study, saponin was used to permeabilise the cell membrane. Saponin is a cell permeabilser which acts by forming complexes with cholesterol leading to a reduction in cell membrane integrity, while keeping mitochondrial membranes intact ( Jamur & Oliver, 2010 ). When mitochondria are isolated from cells, the architecture and morphology of the mitochondria is altered ( Bach et al., 2003 ;   Mitra et al., 2009 ;   Sarin et al., 2013 ;   Hagenbuchner et al., 2013 ), but permeabilisation of the cell membrane allows the architecture and morphology of mitochondria to remain normal, an advantage  Tomas et al. (2019),   PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.6500   2/14\n\nover the use of isolated mitochondria as mitochondrial function has previously been shown to have a strong relationship with structure ( Saks et al., 1998 ;   Picard et al., 2011 ). Permeabilisation of the cell membrane allows the effect of substrates on mitochondrial activity to be comprehensively assessed by allowing endogenous substrates to be delivered to mitochondria ( Clerc & Polster, 2012 ). The addition of different substrates and inhibitors alters mitochondrial respiration and allows the activity of individual components of mitochondrial respiration to be measured ( Salabei, Gibb & Hill, 2014 ). Originally described by Chance and Williams in 1955, mitochondrial respiratory activity can be measured in terms of several respiratory ‘states’ ( Chance & Williams, 1955 ). State 3 respiration, state 4 respiration and respiratory control ratio (RCR) are often used as markers for mitochondrial respiratory activity. State 3 respiration is when mitochondria have a high concentration of ADP externally, and a high oxygen consumption rate and ATP synthesis thus producing a state whereby ADP stimulated respiration can be measured ( Chance & Williams, 1955 ;  Chance & Williams, 1956 ). State 4 respiration, on the other hand, is when mitochondria have a very low external ADP concentration, and little or no ATP synthesis due to the complete phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) is a measure of the coupling of ATP synthesis and electron flux and shows the capacity of mitochondria to synthesise ATP via the oxidation of respiratory substrates ( Hill et al., 2012 ). This work aimed to determine if the enzymatic activity of different complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain differed between CFS patients and healthy controls either locally, in the skeletal muscle, or systemically in PBMCs.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Study participants  CFS and control derived primary myoblasts were obtained from muscle biopsies of the  vastus lateralis   of CFS patients and healthy controls and processed and gifted by Dr Audrey Brown, Newcastle University. All CFS patients fulfilled the Fukuda diagnostic criteria and were recruited via the Newcastle NHS CFS Clinical Service at the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ( Fukuda et al., 1994 ). Blood samples were obtained from patients fulfilling the Fukuda Diagnostic criteria for CFS after obtaining ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Committee North East—Newcastle & North Tyneside 2 ( Fukuda et al., 1994 ). Samples from healthy controls were collected through the Institute of Cellular Medicine (Newcastle University) blood s",

It is het- erogeneous in presentation without diagnostic indicators; therefore, in health care encounters, insight must be gained from the patient’s perspective. One indicator of impact can be gained by measuring quality of life (QoL). By applying a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), professionals can gather insights with direct relevance to the patient questioned. Such a tool can act therapeutically tool to promote holistic and individualized professional interventions and interval measurement can inform commissioning of specialist services. Standard practice appears not fully to capture the experience of CFS, while a search of the literature turned up QoL patient-reported outcome tools, but failed to reveal a CFS/ME-specific measure. The author explores a valid and reliable PROM that can monitor change and evaluate the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence rehabilitation program, as delivered by specialist National Health Service units. An alternative, the World Health Organization’s quality-of life instrument (WHOQoL)-Bref26, is reviewed for relevance to the condition, measuring treatment outcomes and the wider debate of measuring QoL in LTCs.  Keywords:   long-term conditions, patient perspective, assessment, quality of life, measurement  Introduction  Background  Approximately 15.4 million of the population in England report a long-term condition (LTC). 1,2   Monitoring patients’ level of disability by assessing overall effect on quality of life (QoL) is regarded as essential by the author. 3   A 2010 white paper 4   emphasized the ability of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to enhance LTC manage- ment, not to be confused with satisfaction surveys. 5   Nevertheless, the Medical Research Council   6   and Reuben and Tinetti   7   intimate that general tools may inadequately reflect experiences or the outcome of intervention in many LTCs. The author observes that despite best professional efforts, gaining a measurable understanding of the effect of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions can be considered problematic.   8,9   PROMs are developing into a versatile interven- tion that provides a rich data set and acts as a quality-improvement tool. 9   However, measures need to be sensitive enough to capture complex variables and the impact of comorbidities 10   and to inform clinical commissioning. 11 The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) CFS program delivered by specialist services promotes accurate diagnosis and practical recom-  Correspondence: Deb Roberts Ward 10, Alexandra Wing, Broadgreen Hospital, Thomas Drive, Liverpool, Merseyside L14 3LB, UK Tel   + 44 151 282 6185 Fax   + 44 151 282 6188 Email deborah.roberts@rlbuht.nhs.uk\n\nPatient Related Outcome Measures 2018:9 submit your manuscript   | www.dovepress.com  Dovepress Dovepress  254  Roberts  mendations that emphasize working in partnership, taking account of needs and preferences. An overview of strategies is offered in this article in relation to what the author is seek- ing to measure. Managing both the physical and emotional components of the condition with an individualized approach includes cognitive behavioral and (for some) graded exercise approaches.   NHS tertiary services, along with many other specialties, do not form part of The UK National Clini- cal Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme.   12,13   However, intensive users of the expensive health care services, the author is aware of the urgency to positively influence the LTC-reporting agenda and CFS specifically. 14,15   This review seeks to explore a valid and reliable care measure that cap- tures QoL, monitors change, and evaluates practice.  The condition  CFS, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is an LTC with significant and unpredictable symptoms and uncertain duration. 6   Often referred to as ME/CFS in leading literature, new descriptors are under discussion.   16   However, the NICE guidelines descriptor of CFS/ME will be the term applied in this article. As CFS/ME is heterogeneous in nature and without medical or diagnostic markers, those with the ill- ness are frequently disbelieved, despite the dramatic changes to functional abilities and emotional well-being.   17   GPs are likely to have up to 40 patients experiencing symptoms, and upward of 50% will need input from specialist services. 18 The author agrees with Reynolds et al,   19   who emphasized the extensive burden of CFS/ME symptoms that require robust initiatives and without which prognosis is poor. The UK NICE guideline estimates a minimum prevalence in primary care of 0.2%,   6   although a unified case definition or etiology is yet to achieve consensus. 20   Despite fierce debate, there is a suggestion that physiological, neurological, and/ or autoimmune dysfunction combine to produce devastating physical, emotional, social,   and economic consequences. 21 Prior to the development of symptoms, patients most frequently report severe illness, surgery, accident, and/or physical and psychological or emotional trauma.   22   Evidence exists that under the influence of such triggers, the condition begins with circadian rhythm dysregulation. 23   A debilitating fatigue that is unlike everyday tiredness and not resolved by sleep or rest is reported, along with difficulties in memory and concentration. 24   The developing sleep disorder results in daytime sleep, and the enforced rest rapidly develops into severe muscle deconditioning. 25   Often described as the “pay- back phenomenon”, patients recount an increase in symptoms of myalgia, dizziness, and tachycardia.   26   Although not fully understood, symptoms including nausea, muscle tension, and disruption to bowel and bladder function also occur. It appears that the autonomic nervous system and fight-or-flight response are more greatly activated as patients attempt to maintain their previous functional lifestyle and responsi- bilities levels. 26   Sufferers experience a downward spiral of physical symptoms that can result in reactive anxiety and depression.   27,28   Fenouillet et   al   29   confirms that pathogenesis appeare to be multifactorial. 30  Current practice  The minimum data set (MDS) of PROMs agreed upon by the British Association of CFS/ME Professionals (BACME) 7 utilizes well-recognized and validated measures (Table 1). Fatigue, sleep, and self-efficacy are reviewed in a well-repli- cated format, although the questions are general in nature. 31–33 Pain is represented by a visual analog scale. 34   Many very specific but perhaps not entirely relevant physical activity descriptors are captured with the Short Form (SF)-36   – physi- cal function scale,   35   and mood through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 36   In common with other CFS specialists, the author suggests that HADS can confuse mood change with the results of fatigue. A narrow exploration of QoL is included through the EuroQol (EQ)-5D, 37   the Clinical Global Improvement scale rating overall change at discharge when the MDS is repeated. 38   The emphasis has been to assess  Table 1   Questionnaires  Description Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire 31  Ten questions designed to describe difficulties  with fatigue and associated symptoms, with four scored categories ranging from 0 (less than) to 3 (much more than)  Epworth Sleepiness Scale 32  Eight activity inquiries and likelihood of sleeping: 0 (never) to 3 (high chance of dozing)  Self-Efficacy  Scale for Chronic Illness 33  Six inquiries beginning “How confident are you  . . .” managing fatigue, physical, emotional/other symptoms, tasks, and other on a 10-point scale:  1 (not confident) to 10 (completely confident)  Visual Analog Scale – pain 34  Measured 0–100%  Short Form 36   35   Ten questions about physical activity, with three responses: 1 (limited a lot), 2 (a little), or 3 (not at all)  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale   36  Mood measure with seven questions for anxiety and seven for depression; four score responses: 0 (no impact) to 3 (frequently affected)  European Quality of Life Measure 37  Five questions on mobility, self-care, activity, pain, and mood in three categories: 1 (no  problems) to 3 (extremely disabling) difficulties  Clinical Global Impression   38  Seven questions, with responses ranging from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse)\n\nPatient Related Outcome Measures 2018:9   submit your manuscript   | www.dovepress.com  Dovepress Dovepress  255  Chronic fatigue syndrome and quality of life  changes in physical function and ensure mood is monitored within specialist care. 12 However, the author finds the prescribed questionnaires time-consuming, with limi",

This systematic review aimed to assess  whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in ME/CFS and OI, and whether the presence of both conditions leads  to an additional decline in CBF.  Methods   PubMed (from 1943), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1947) and Cochrane were searched from  inception to February 14th, 2025, using terms including “chronic fatigue syndrome”, “myalgic encephalomyelitis”,  “orthostatic intolerance” and “cerebral blood flow”. Article selection required the following criteria: published in English;  CBF measured in participants with either ME/CFS or OI, or both ME/CFS and OI combined. Quality assessment and risk  of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and the systematic review was conducted in accordance with  the PRISMA 2020 guidelines.  Results   Of 14,928 articles, 118 were included, 26 (22.1%) of which studied CBF in ME/CFS alone, 81 (68.6%) in OI  alone and 11 (9.3%) in both ME/CFS and OI. Overall, the articles included 9185 participants, with a mean age of  39.1 years (SD   =   8.8), and 73.8% of participants were female. Studies found CBF was significantly reduced in 12 of the  articles focused on ME/CFS and in 56 of those focused on OI; compared to controls. Additionally, in 4 out of 11 studies  that examined both conditions, CBF was further reduced in participants suffering from both conditions compared to  those with ME/CFS alone.  Conclusions   CBF is reduced in ME/CFS and OI alone and having both conditions comorbidly amplifies CBF  reductions. Therefore, observing CBF changes in ME/CFS with and without OI may be important in monitoring disease  severity. Despite this, few studies focus on the combination of ME/CFS and OI, and OI may be a confounding factor in  CBF in a large portion of ME/CFS studies.

Journal of Translational Medicine   (2025) 23:963  Introduction  Myalgic   encephalomyelitis/chronic   fatigue   syndrome  (ME/CFS) is characterised by persistent fatigue, post-  exertional   malaise   (PEM),   brain   fog   and   unrefresh -  ing sleep lasting at least 6 months [ 1 ]. Symptoms affect  multiple body systems and are often accompanied by  multiple heterogenous symptoms and comorbid con -  ditions [ 2 ]. It is estimated that between 28 and 82% of  adults and up to 96% of adolescents [ 1 ,   3 ,   4 ] with ME/  CFS experience orthostatic intolerance (OI) symptoms,  which refers to symptoms that include light-headed -  ness,   dizziness,   blurred   vision,   tachycardia,   nausea,  disequilibrium and fainting that appear when upright  and resolve when returning to a supine position [ 5 ]. OI  symptoms are a key component of the diagnostic crite -  ria for ME/CFS [ 1 ,   6 – 9 ] and are thought to be attributed  to a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Reduction in  CBF is linked to autonomic nervous system dysfunction,  which leads to abnormal haemodynamic control of heart  rate and blood pressure when postural changes occur [ 3 ].  The most common forms of OI in ME/CFS patients are  postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and  orthostatic hypotension (OH) [ 3 ,   10 ], with OI in ME/CFS  patients typically intensifying during PEM events [ 11 ].  Adequate and relatively constant CBF is critical to  maintaining consciousness and functioning and reduced  CBF may be a large contributing factor to the cognitive  impairment seen in ME/CFS, commonly known as ‘brain  fog’ [ 12 ]. Brain fog is common in both ME/CFS patients  with and without OI in addition to the characteristic  symptom of fatigue in ME/CFS and PEM events. Mul -  tiple techniques currently are available to measure CBF  [ 13 ], with the most commonly utilised including mag -  netic resonance imaging (MRI), doppler ultrasound, near  infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and transcranial doppler  ultrasound echography (TCD). However, assessment of  CBF is not currently required to diagnose either ME/CFS  or OI despite many patients reporting the experience of  OI symptoms without presenting with the characteris -  tic heart rate or blood pressure fluctuations associated  with orthostasis in various OI conditions [ 3 ]. There are  currently no known diagnostic biomarkers available for  ME/CFS and this often results in diagnostic delays, which  have been associated with reduced rates of recovery and  symptom improvement [ 14 ]. In addition to ME/CFS,  OI conditions can often be difficult to diagnose, with  patients waiting an average of 4.9 years until diagnosis  [ 15 ]. As CBF reductions are known to occur in both these  conditions, utilising CBF measurement techniques as  diagnostic tools may assist in reduced time to diagnosis  and improved patient outcomes in both ME/CFS and OI.  Importantly, decreased CBF has been observed in ME/  CFS patients without OI, highlighting that measuring  CBF could be a critical tool for monitoring disease sever -  ity and PEM events in these patients.  The aim of this systematic review is to determine if  CBF is decreased in patients with ME/CFS and OI and  to evaluate whether there are further decreases in CBF in  patients with both ME/CFS and OI as comorbidities.  Methods  Search strategy  A systematic review of the literature was conducted  using databases that included PubMed (from 1943), Ovid  MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE classic and Embase  (from 1947) and Cochrane Central Register of Con -  trolled Trials (CENTRAL) which were searched from  inception to February 14th, 2025. The review protocol  was registered with PROSPERO International prospec -  tive register of systematic reviews (registration number:  CRD42023376018) [ 16 ] and was formulated according  to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews  and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ 17 ]. The search  terms used included “chronic fatigue syndrome”, “myalgic  encephalomyelitis”, “ME/CFS”, “orthostatic intolerance”,  “orthostatic   hypotension”,   “neurocardiogenic   syncope”,  “vasovagal   syncope”,   “postural   orthostatic   tachycardia  syndrome”, “POTS”, “cerebral blood flow”, “brain blood  flow” and “cerebral perfusion” (Supplementary Material  1 ).  Article selection  Identified articles were managed using the reference  management software EndNote (Version 21 Clarivate  Analytics, Philadelphia, USA). Duplicate articles were  removed using EndNote and the articles that remained  were exported to Covidence systematic review software  (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) for  screening. Two independent reviewers (EMC and DT  or KH) each assessed the titles and abstracts and sub -  sequently the full texts of articles not excluded at this  stage were downloaded for further assessment against  the exclusion criteria to obtain the final included articles.  Disagreements that arose between reviewers regarding  inclusion of articles were resolved by a third reviewer  (CWA).  Eligibility criteria  Articles   were   included   in   this   systematic   review   if  they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) CBF was  Keywords   ME/CFS, Myalgic encephalomyelitis, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Orthostatic intolerance, Cerebral blood  flow\n\nPage 3 of 23 Christopoulos   et al.
