# Planned Features

This directory contains feature proposals, enhancement ideas, and roadmap planning.

## Purpose

Store and organize:

- Feature proposals and specifications
- Enhancement requests
- Roadmap milestones
- Technical exploration documents
- Future improvement ideas

## Usage

Create individual markdown files for each feature or initiative. Use descriptive names:

- `feature-name.md` - Detailed feature specification
- `enhancement-name.md` - Improvement proposal
- `milestone-name.md` - Roadmap milestone planning

## Format Suggestion

Each feature document can include:

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the feature

## Motivation
Why this feature is needed

## Requirements
- Functional requirements
- Technical requirements

## Implementation Notes
High-level approach

## Open Questions
Things to resolve before implementation
```

## Task Management

Active development tasks are tracked using Cursor's native todo system, not in these files.
